         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>ſter.</note> (whom many of you know to be moſt notorious for falſe ſwearing, publicke drunkenneſſe, and blaſphemy, for which the laſt yeare at the publicke Seſſions he was bound to his good behaviour:) I was voted a Delinquent by ſome of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> and publiſhed in a Diurnall over the Nation, to preach ſuch fooliſh ſtuffe, which none (I hope) that know me, ſuſpect of me: hereupon being ſent for by a Meſſenger, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to cuſtody, I was at laſt referred to the <hi>Committee</hi> for ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Miniſters, that ſo I might afterward be reckoned in that number, and diſabled thereby from doing Chriſt any more ſervice: (for a Miniſter marked with that badge by them (they call the Parliament) is more odious then he that is made ſuch a one by ſinne or Satan:) ſo that when I returned home, the drunken Crew (whoſe vicious lives I had oft inveighed againſt) and their children too; would point at me as I went in the ſtreets, and ſay, there goes a ſcandalous Miniſter, there goes he that was in the Gaole, with his fellow Rogues the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day.</p>
            <p>After this, when by Maſter <hi>Marſhall's</hi> friendſhip and teſtimony of me, I obtained to put in Baile, I was forced to make many journeys
<pb facs="tcp:155912:3"/> this laſt winter-time to <hi>London</hi> (being almoſt forty miles from mine habitation) for preaching againſt Lying and Slandering, Pride and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, ſinnes notorious in my neighbours, who had now got the tricke (becauſe all was beleeved againſt me which they ſaid) to affirme, that what-ever I preached was againſt the <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſo making <hi>that</hi> and their owne ſinnes all one, (for <hi>that</hi> indeed was able to doe me more hurt then they:) and though I never failed upon the leaſt intimation to appeare, yet I was ſent for againe by a Purſevant, (as if I had not beene bailed) becauſe that was moſt chargeable, whereby a great part of that little money which in ten yeares ſpace I had ſaved to keepe my wife and children (if I ſhould die) was expended.</p>
            <p>And now at laſt when it was perceived, that neither by threats, nor moleſtations, nor charges, nor weary journies, I would be forced to deny the truth of God, my debauched adverſary (knowing as ſhould ſeeme the intentions of his powerfull friends) layed wagers, that he would quite put me by from preaching, and turne me out of my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; wherefore having forced many of my ſimple people to make a purſe to beare his charges, (by threatning them elſe with plundering, and the imputation of being counted <hi>Cavaliers</hi>) he repaires againe unto <hi>London,</hi> and on the third of <hi>March</hi> in the name not onely of the <hi>Commons,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Lords,</hi> (before whom I never appeared, nor was ever ſummoned) hee obtained a <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> to be granted to ſome others, (my deadly enemies of his owne knot) to ſeize upon my Parſonage-Houſe, Glebe, and Tythes, and a power withall to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend my perſon to doe with me God knowes what: And (as the words of the <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> are) <hi>for the better ſupply of an able and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man in the Church,</hi> they ſent downe a ſtranger to officiate as Parſon in my place, whom they call a godly, learned, and orthodox Divine, intimating thereby unto the world, that he whom they caſt out was not to be accounted any ſuch a one: what I am or have beene (my Chriſtian friends) I referre to your judgements who have knowne me; I thanke God I am able to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I have walked in all good conſcience both before God and man unto this day;</hi> I have conſtantly preached twice upon the Lords day, and oft on Holydayes when I could intreat my people to come to Church: But if that their godly, learned, and orthodox Divine be ſuch a one as is their Lecturer, whom in deſpight of me they did (in the beginning of my troubles)
<pb facs="tcp:155912:4"/> ſet up to preach againſt Gods truth, and me in mine owne Church, I thinke they will have (amongſt them that are wiſe and godly) but little credit by him.</p>
            <p>Concerning which Lecturer<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>One</hi> Lemuell Tuke.</note> ſome of you (my Chriſtian friends) did at firſt conceive and ſay of him, that <hi>had he beene good, the barren Country from whence he came would not have parted with him:</hi> in briefe by education he is a <hi>Weaver,</hi> of no Univerſity, yet one that hath a charge of ſoules in <hi>Notttinghamſhire,</hi> from which ever ſince the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> began, he hath beene a conſtant <hi>Non-reſident,</hi> for his Pariſh then framed a Bill againſt him to the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> articling him to be negligent, and inſufficient in his place, to be guilty of <hi>Barrettry</hi> and <hi>Battery,</hi> to be famed of <hi>Drunkenneſſe, Whoredome,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch (as they are now accounted in ſome) ſmall offences; upon which he fled the Country into our parts, and being more ſuteable to the temper of my people then I am, they made choice of him: among whom he blaſphemeth Gods holy Word, preacheth Sedition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, telleth in the Pulpit many fooliſh lyes and ridiculous tales, bawleth againſt the Reverend and Learned Miniſters of the Country, and raileth upon the Worſhipfull Gentry; and ſo many wayes hee poyſoneth the ſoules of them that are committed to my Cure, which is my greateſt griefe of all. But the Lord I hope will not lay to the charge of his poore perſecuted Miniſter the dammage that is thus done unto the ſpirits of his people; for God himſelfe knoweth that I offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Chaire-man of the <hi>Committee</hi> (my drunken Adverſaries faſt friend) to keepe a Lecture my ſelfe on the weeke day, if any did deſire it, rather then have my flocke defiled with ſuch ſeditious and wicked Doctrines, as I knew that Lecturer would teach among them. My re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brethren and friends, ſome of you thought me much abuſed by the intruſion of him: I doubt not but you thinke me in your hearts more wronged now, by being after all thoſe former troubles turned out of my Living, my Wife, Children, and aged Parent expoſed to the wide world, and my ſelfe forced to ſeeke ſafety in ſtrange places by flying: but bleſſed be God yet, my <hi>flight was not in the Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sed quid mali feci,</hi> What Law of God or man is it that I have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which doth expoſe me to theſe miſeries? O that ſome would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto me my tranſgreſſions, for as yet I am (to my knowledge) a Delinquent, upon no other ground then the bare accuſation and word
<pb facs="tcp:155912:4"/> of my enemy: when ten of my neighbours ſufficiently furniſhed with evill affections, were ſent for up againſt me, they were not able to ſpeake me culpable in any thing, ſave in <hi>the matter of my God;</hi> and when I urged them before the <hi>Committee</hi> and ſpectators, to ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ever heard me ſpeake word of evill againſt the <hi>Parliament</hi> in publicke or private, they could not ſay it; nor deny, but I conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayed for it; onely my chiefe adverſary ſaid in behalfe of himſelfe and the reſt, <hi>We thinke that in his preaching he meant the Parliament;</hi> and becauſe my enemies did <hi>thinke</hi> ſo, ſome of the Members (as it ſhould ſeeme) did thinke ſo too; whoſe thoughts (in ſuch a caſe) 'tis not comely for me to gain-ſay.</p>
            <p>I dealt ingenuouſly before the <hi>Committee,</hi> relating the truth of what I had preached, (although I might eaſily ſuſpect, that ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in regard of the malignity of the times, might prove to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage) with which my candor and plainneſſe divers honourable Members of the <hi>Committee</hi> were ſo well pleaſed, that they concluded to have me reported to the Houſe as a man deſerving their favour: but as appeares, (unknowing I beleeve to them in particular) ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did intend, and have now done otherwiſe; for five moneths after (as if I had never anſwered at all) this<note n="*" place="margin">The Copy of which <hi>Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> is at the end of this Booke.</note> 
               <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> againſt me comes forth, wherein are ſome expreſſions alleadged (that I ſhould uſe in thoſe my Sermons) as the cauſe of this my puniſhment, which are now ſhewne up and downe to juſtifie the pretended equity of the ſame; but they are ſo falſe and ſo fooliſh, that I need not confute them to you that know me: or indeed, were they all true of me, I beleeve you would ſay, if you durſt ſpeake, that my penalty exceeds my ſinne.</p>
            <p>In the ſeven firſt Sections of this following Diſcourſe, which is the pith of ſome 8 Sermons preached in the moneths of June and July laſt, when my Troubles firſt begun, you ſhall ſee the truth of God which I ſuffer for: and that you may not tax mee of folly for preaching this truth, at this time when 'tis ſo much diſcountenanced, I will breifely tell you the occaſion that moved mee to't.</p>
            <p>I conceived that the Houſe of Commons (when they ſet forth the Proteſtation) did foreſee, that <hi>the Doctrine eſtabliſhed in this Church of</hi> England, <hi>The Kings Perſon, Honour, and eſtate, the Power and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament,</hi> were or would be in ſome ſpeciall danger, or
<pb facs="tcp:155912:5"/> dammage, now more then formerly they had beene, and therefore did thereby provide that we ſhould ingage our ſelves to defend them: and for my part I was reall in what I did, having taken the ſame I truly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in my calling to keepe it; and therefore when I ſaw people inclining to rebellion and ſtrife, I declared <hi>that,</hi> to be rather the doctrine of Antichriſt and Popery, then of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which taught peace and commanded patience: this preſently purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me the ſuſpicion, and ſoone after the name of a <hi>Malignant:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hearing men unreverently ſpeak of the <hi>Kings Majeſties perſon,</hi> I oppoſed that blaſphemy by Gods Word, and endeavoured to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his Honour according to my duty and Proteſtation: this produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced mee the title of a <hi>Royalliſt,</hi> yea of a ranke <hi>Cavaleer,</hi> and I ſhould have a Buffe Coat and a Scarlet paire of Hoſe bought mee preſently to make mee compleat. And then Secondly obſerving people on their owne heads, rending Common prayer bookes, and altering things eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law, I inveighed againſt thoſe doings, as injurious to the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>priviledge</hi> of Parliament, which by my proteſtation alſo, I was bound to maintaine; and this (they ſaid) diſcovered mee to be a plaine <hi>Papiſt,</hi> one that loved the <hi>Maſſe</hi> booke better then I did <hi>God:</hi> ſo there I had preached away my good name, but my comfort was I had two witneſſes: God, and my owne Conſcience, which would ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify me in my way: <hi>ſed Hinc dolor, hinc Lachrimae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further (for I will confeſſe all againſt my ſelfe,) I have beene charged, to have beene a great Hinderer of the Parliament proceedings in the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> and gathering money in that well affected County of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> if I have, 'tis more by my Sufferings then any other way, and if God pleaſe to make me an Inſtrument to prevent ſin in others, though by mine owne ſorrowes, I will rejoyce in my tribulations: I confeſſe my Scandalous Adverſaries have added ſome fame and credit to my ſufferings, as well as mine owne Innocency, and their malice is the more obſerved with wonder, at their ſucceſſe and favour with ſome Members in the Houſe of Commons: becauſe ſome ſix weekes before they complained of me to them, divers of theſe my perſecuting neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (whereof the debauched Drunkard was one) had convented me before the Juſtice of peace, for omitting the <hi>Croſſe</hi> and <hi>Surplice,</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the worthy Gentleman (to his admiration) to inflict the penalty of the ſtatute upon mee for the ſame, when as notwithſtanding at that
<pb facs="tcp:155912:5"/> time in other places to other perſons, they did raile upon mee for u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Common prayer booke at all, which ſoone after they rent in peeces.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, another reaſon of this my uſage hath beene alleadged by a Member of the Houſe to be this: The <hi>King</hi> (ſaies he) turnes out thoſe Miniſters that be for the Parliament, and we muſt provide for them, and how ſhould we ſo do, but by turning out thoſe that be for the King? but I beleeve His worſhip was miſinformed of His Majeſty, for unto that day I cannot yet heare (though I have inquired) that the King had ſequeſtred any living, or turned any Miniſter out: perhaps ſome whoſe Conſciences accuſed them for preaching treaſon and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, did run away when His Majeſties forces approached: and in pity to the peoples ſoules ſo forſaken ſome might be appointed by His Majeſty to preach unto them.</p>
            <p>But ſuch wrongs upon ſuch grounds, unto the Kings Subjects that are peaceable and loyall, will make men ſee and beleeve what hath beene foretold them by their Soveraigne; and to further that worke, had I another Living (I hope) I ſhould be content to looſe it.</p>
            <p>And now (my Chriſtian Brethren and friends) you have heard alſo the reaſons of my trouble &amp; perſecution, judge in your ſecret thoughts betweene mee and my enemies. I hope I never gave occaſion of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to the godly wiſe, I am ready to give an account of my whole faith: I tooke occaſion from a conference with Maſter <hi>Marſhall,</hi> to publiſh my judgement in the caſe for which I ſuffer, that I might give ſatisfaction to you all, and that you might ſee, I have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for my diſſent from him, and ſome others of my brethren; I dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it as to him in particular, ſo to you all in generall: from whoſe hands I begge foure things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you would not thinke the worſe of that High and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court of Parliament for any of my ſufferings, nor interpret that any word in theſe ſucceeding Sections, is intended againſt the ſame: I have profeſſed before it, and ſo I do now to you, and to the world, that next to Chriſt, and the King, I judge my ſelfe bound in duty to endeavour the honour of it: I neither do, nor dare in conſcience attribute the wrong that hath beene done mee, to the major part of that part which is now ſitting; onely this I ſay, ſome particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, (who as men) being ſeduced by ill Counſell have beene the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb facs="tcp:155912:6"/> of my unkind neighbours thus to abuſe mee, whoſe ſinne God pardon, and whoſe hearts God in mercy turne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That you would beare in mind, that this publication of my faith &amp; judgement in the caſe, is the Conſequent of my troubles, indeed oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by them; for <hi>I have ſuffered and therefore do I ſpeake;</hi> this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; to the end you might be witneſſes for me, if afterward out of theſe following lines ſomewhat ſhould be picked, wreſted, and allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as the cauſe of my ſufferings; for I obſerve, that 'tis the cuſtome of theſe times by doing wrong to urge men to complaine, and then from their expreſſions to get ſome colour for their former evill doing againſt them; when my ſelfe did firſt appeare before the Committee my charge was, onely of a Sermon preached the Lords day after I had beene voted a <hi>Delinquent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That you would not thinke my preſent flight to be a relinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the cauſe, I never balked to appear upon the leaſt intimations, untill now that power was put into the hands of my raging Enemies, which (for ought I know, was to kill mee;) indeed it was threatned before (as was evidenced upon oath) before a Juſtice, that <hi>I ſhould be cut off, as not being fitting to live;</hi> whereupon I went to that Member, who was the Cheife inſtrument of my trouble, and deſired of him that I might be brought rather to ſuffer for this cleare truth of God in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, as the <hi>Martyrs</hi> in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes did (which I hoped God would enable me to endure, that I might glorify him by my death) then be murdered in private, as I was threatned; he indeed made a tuſh at mee, and ſaid <hi>there was but one man that had ſaid it:</hi> But I am by Gods grace of the ſame minde ſtill, when ever I may in publicke give teſtimony to this truth of God, I will not keepe in ſecret.</p>
            <p n="4">4. My Chriſtian friends I deſire of you in the laſt place, that I may not fare the worſe at your hands, becauſe I have fared ſo ill at the hands of others, the world's cuſtome is, to judge of men according to it's owne uſage of them, though Chriſt was more afflicted then other men. The Apoſtle tels us that <hi>to you is given not onely to beleeve, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſuffer;</hi> and if God gives ſuffering grace, he will ſurely ſend afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the exerciſe of it; indeed the times are evill, but we muſt not ſay ſo: <hi>ſeculo premimur gravi, quo ſcelera regnant,</hi> the world goes ill when ſin reigneth; but remember, <hi>non eſt ad aſtra mollis è terris via.</hi> through many tribulations we muſt go to Heaven, <hi>&amp; inviſa nunquam
<pb facs="tcp:155912:6"/> imperia retinentur diu,</hi> this world will not laſt alwaies, <hi>egrediemur tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi> we ſhall be freed from all our ſorrowes at the laſt, the merits of Chriſt will make amends for all: and in the meane time if the example of theſe my ſufferings may any way be ſerviceable unto you my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian friends, I ſhall rejoice the more in them: I am not mine owne, I am Chriſts, nay I am yours by Chriſts appointment, who hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his poore Miniſter (bleſſed be his name) not onely to preach the croſſe of Chriſt unto you, but alſo to carry it before you. I beg all your prayers for ſtrength from him, to whom I commend all you, even to our onely wiſe and omnipotent God, who will turne all things in the end to our everlaſting good, to whom be praiſe and glory for ever. <hi>Amen,</hi>

For as <hi>Scripture</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other writings, ſo <hi>Kings</hi> above all other perſons have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate dependance upon God,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.21.</note> they are of his ſole making: <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth, and ſetteth up Kings:</hi> And Kingdomes are of his owne diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.25.</note> 
                  <hi>The moſt High ruleth in the Kingdome of men, and gives it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rom: 13.1.</note>And although it is moſt true, that <hi>all the powers that be are ordained of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 19.11.</note> and <hi>there is no power but what is given from above:</hi> for as, <hi>by him Kings Reigne:</hi> ſo alſo, <hi>by him Princes rule, and Nobles, yea all the Iudges of the earth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 8.15, 16.</note> yet I beleeve all inferiour powers under the King, are from God more remotely, namely <hi>(mediante Rege)</hi> by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſupreme, even as the leſſer Starres have their light from God, by the mediation of the Sunne: they are the Kings delegates, <hi>ordained and ſent by him</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) who is ſent by God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.14.</note> and is under God the chiefe: <hi>à Deo ſecundus, poſt quem primus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian.</hi>

And hence too, the King or ſupreme hath his Patent immediately from God: He is <hi>Rex Dei gratiâ,</hi> and his title is, <hi>Gode Deputy,</hi> or the <hi>Miniſter of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.</note> but the Inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates have their Patents from the King, they are <hi>Magiſtratus Regis gratiâ,</hi> and are intituled, the <hi>Kings Miniſters,</hi> or the <hi>Kings Iudges.</hi> And as the man is ſaid to be <hi>the Image of God,</hi> and the woman to be the <hi>Image of the man,</hi> upon whom ſhe hath dependance,<note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> is to them as <hi>Moſes</hi> was to <hi>Aaron</hi> and the other Judges,<note place="margin">Ex. 4.16.</note>

               <p>And hence I gather that none can call Soveraigne Princes to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (if they tranſgreſſe) but only God, whoſe immediate ſtewards they are, <hi>ſolum Deum quem habent Authorem habent quoque judicem:</hi> &amp; therefore <hi>David</hi> well; <hi>tibi, tibi ſoli peccavi, againſt thee,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And I do beleeve, that the <hi>Prince</hi> who is once poſſeſſed of a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> coming to him by <hi>Inheritance</hi> can never by any, upon any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be diſpoſſeſſed thereof againe, without Horrible impiety, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Injuſtice in the Inſtruments: <hi>Royall unction</hi> was an indeleble Character of old;<note place="margin">2.

               <p>Now <hi>Royall Birth-right</hi> being the ſame in ſenſe with <hi>Royall uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it followes that he who is truly borne unto a Kingdome, is in like

               </p>
               <p>Yea I believe that the eldeſt Son of ſuch a <hi>King</hi> is in reſpect of birth <hi>the Lords anoynted</hi> in his fathers life time, even as <hi>David</hi> was before <hi>Sauls</hi> death' and to deprive Him of his <hi>right</hi> in reverſion, is as true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, as to diſpoſſeſſe him of it, were he actually inveſted with it.</p>
               <p>I believe, where <hi>unction</hi> ſpeaks not, <hi>Inheritance</hi> by birth is the <hi>beſt Title</hi> to a Kingdome; had <hi>unction</hi> been ſilent, <hi>Adoniiah</hi> by this had ſurely prevailed as the ſucceeding <hi>Kings</hi> of Judah did, Solomons own words to his mother inferre as much 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.22. <hi>aske for him the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome alſo for he is mine Elder brother.</hi> as in this our Nation <hi>Birth</hi> hath alwayes been the <hi>beſt</hi> and moſt unqueſtionable <hi>plea</hi> unto the <hi>Crowne:</hi> the <hi>Conque-rour</hi> himſelfe made uſe of it, ſo did <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Richard</hi> the 3. though both uſurpers, we may obſerve how Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall providence &amp; bleſſing hath alwayes favoured this <hi>title,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd it: they that marke what ſtory tels, concerning the oppoſite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors of ſome, both in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, &amp; <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> dayes, muſt needs confeſſe Gods ſpeciall care, in conveying the Kingdome to that <hi>Royall family</hi> where now 'tis ſeated, being line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſcended in the Elder ſurviving bloud, from both the divided <hi>Houſes</hi> after the union: And on the other ſide it is moſt evident that God hath ſharply puniſhed thoſe that have offered wrong unto <hi>right of Inheritance,</hi> yea, the whole <hi>Nation</hi> hath loſt much both <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Vulgar</hi> bloud in former times, for ſuffering injuſtice to be done unto it, if we remember but the wars between <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> we ſhall finde ſomewhat in the root of them to this purpoſe.</p>

                  <hi>Authority</hi> is extinguiſhed; but the very Perſon of a <hi>King</hi> (in regard of royall birth or unction, and of immediate dependance upon God) is <hi>ſacred</hi> as well as his <hi>Authority,</hi> and doth adde veneration unto that, as well as that to him: indeed they adde honour to each other, and are inſeperable, they live and dye together, they are of Gods conjunction, (whereas other Authority is of mans) and though man may ſever what himſelfe hath joyned, <hi>yet what God hath joyned no man muſt ſever.</hi>

               <p>Chriſt came at firſt in the ſhape of a ſervant, was humble to all, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective to the Civill Magiſtrate, did not reſiſt his will though contrary to Law, and like him herein I beleeve muſt all Chriſtians be, of what ranke ſoever (as ſuch) under the <hi>Supreame:</hi> they muſt be meeke and lowly, patient when contemned, and (if providence ſo order) that they be delivered up to the will of the people their moſt deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for no cauſe, as Chriſt was againſt all Law of God or Man, like him they muſt make no bodily reſiſtance againſt <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when Chriſt ſhall come the ſecond time, he ſhall appeare after another manner, <hi>viz.</hi> clothed with <hi>Majeſtie</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> as a Judge and Ruler, as <hi>the high and lofty one that inhabiteth Eternity;</hi> nor will he yeild himſelfe then to be deſpiſed and abuſed as he was before: no more will he (I beleeve) long ſuffer thoſe that beare his <hi>Image</hi> in that reſpect to be contemned in the meane while; verily, I doe beleeve, it is the moſt high and tranſcendent boldneſſe that can be imagined to abuſe or ſlight in the leaſt degree the <hi>Image of Chriſt,</hi> as Judge, as God.</p>
               <p>Surely it is the duty of <hi>Soveraigne Kings,</hi> to remember in what ſenſe themſelve are <hi>Chriſti imagines</hi> above other men, that ſo their lookes may be anſwerable to their dignities, for the chaſing away e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill from others, and the preventing of contempt unto themſelves: But if a Prince ſhall be ſo gracious as to deny himſelfe ſometime, in reſpect of his greatneſſe, and (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> at his firſt comeing did) lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his glory for a ſeaſon, to converſe more familiarly with his people for their good, ſhall he (being moſt highly adorned with the ſweet <hi>Spirit of the Goſpell,</hi> and the conditions thereof, meekneſſe, patience, mercy, affability, and the like) rather delight to appear to his Subjects as <hi>Chriſt a Saviour,</hi> then as <hi>Chriſt</hi> a <hi>Iudge,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done, then

               <p>Indeed I believe, that as <hi>the beſt Chriſtians,</hi> ſo the <hi>beſt Kings</hi> in this world, are liable to perſecution both of hand and tongue, in regard of that <hi>Image of God</hi> which is upon them: when the inſurrection of evill doers had <hi>driven David</hi> from his royall City, then did <hi>Shimei's</hi> mouth alſo open againſt him, to the enlargement of his ſorrowes: we know the Scripture tels us, that the nature of the ſelf advancing <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> (when he is gotten up) is to be moſt ſpightfull againſt the <hi>Cedars of Libanus;</hi>

               <p>And this God permitteth ſometimes (for a ſeaſon) to be done even to <hi>Princes</hi> themſelves, that he thereby might have occaſion more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to declare himſelfe their <hi>ſaving ſtrength,</hi> in upholding and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them, and in <hi>ſubduing their people under them;</hi> as alſo that the Eminency of fortitude, wiſedome, meekneſſe, and thoſe other graces, which himſelfe hath planted in a <hi>King</hi> may be manifeſt, to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of his Subjects under their particular Burdens: If we look <hi>unto Ieſus</hi> with the eye of faith, &amp; upon our <hi>Soveraign</hi> with the eye of

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:155912:16"/> confirme this; it doth teach us not onely to difference them from all other men, but alſo to honour them with the ſame inward honour ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately wherewith we honour him: and to my apprehenſion the Law of the Nation conſents hereto, for whereas 'tis no capitall crime, onely to wiſh or ſeeke another mans deſtruction, yet the <hi>Kings</hi> it is; for a bare purpoſe, if no hurt enſue to another, no man ſhall ſuffer death: but 'tis not ſo with a <hi>King,</hi> a bare purpoſe or endeavour to kill him is deadly: yea, we reade of ſome that have loſt their heads, but for raiſing a force to take away (as was pretended) evill Counſellors from the Prince, becauſe the Law did interpret that act to be a ſecret intendment againſt <hi>the life of the Soveraigne;</hi> and as I conceive the reaſon of the Law is this, becauſe as Kings participate of Gods name, (are called <hi>Gods</hi>) ſo doe they of this divine Priviledge, that as againſt God ſo againſt them the thoughts of the heart are mortall ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Yea further, Gods conjunction of the King to himſelfe, and our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to both, under one word feare, <hi>(My ſonne,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.17.</note> doth ſuggeſt that the moſt viſible and immediate evidence that we can poſſibly give of our <hi>fearing God,</hi> is our <hi>honouring the King.</hi> Yea, I doe verily beleeve, that what Gods wiſedome hath conjoyned in his Word, his Spirit hath coupled in every honeſt and religious heart.</p>
               <p>And now as by the feare of God is ſignified the whole worſhip of God, ſo by fearing and honouring the King is underſtood all that duty whereby the dignity, credit, eſteeme, ſafety, content, and comfort of our Soveraigne by any meanes is preſerved and kept undefaced: and as this our feare muſt be the ſame <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> ſo muſt it have the ſame manner and way of expreſſion: as namely by our beleeving him, by having an high eſteeme of him, by our obedience to his will, by our manner of addreſſe unto his preſence, by our unfeigned and conſtant love unto his perſon, and by our endeavouring to rejoyce and glad his ſpirit; for by theſe particulars we doe expreſſe our honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of heart unto the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We honour God</hi> when <hi>we doe beleeve him,</hi> yea then moſt of all (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſayes) for thereby we give him the glory of all his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; nor doe we ever more diſparage the <hi>Majeſtie of God,</hi> then
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:155912:17"/> when we make him a lyer like unto our ſelves, in not giving credit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſayings: thoſe (who would neither beleeve nor ſpeake one word of truth themſelves) did moſt of all diſhonour our Saviour when they voiced him to be a deceiver and a falſe ſpeaker: ſo no greater diſhonour can men offer to their Prince then not to take his word, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe withall to labour that others might not.) Surely it is a part not onely of good manners, but alſo of that reverence and duty which a <hi>Subject</hi> owes unto his <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> to credit and beleeve him before any other in the world, eſpecially upon his Proteſtations: But indeed the more like unto Chriſt a Prince is in meekneſſe, mercy, truth, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of diſpoſition, and deſire of doing good, the more of Chriſt's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteinment ſhall he meet withall in this world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We honour God,</hi> by <hi>having an high eſteeme of his Majeſtie,</hi> and by manifeſting the ſame in termes accordingly, to his praiſe upon all occaſions; and after this ſort muſt we teſtifie our honour to the King, <hi>we muſt have an high and pious conceit of him,</hi> ſpeaking of him alwaies as good, and praying for him not as evill: To make mention in prayer of a <hi>Chriſtian Prince</hi> as if he were an Infidel, or an enemy to goodneſſe, is rather to calumniate and vilifie him to ſlander and diſgrace him, then to ſhew reverence and honour to him: it is rather the way to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a tediouſneſſe of him, and to worke an <hi>odium</hi> againſt him in the hearts of men then a venerable eſteeme of him. When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, as a thing good and acceptable in the ſight of God, <hi>to pray, ſupplicate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and give thankes for Kings,</hi> and commends it as a meane whereby to <hi>live a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſſe and honeſty;</hi> I beleeve he did not intend ſuch kinde of prayers as ſhould leave a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit of Kings in the mindes of their people, no I beleeve ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have beene the ſeeds of theſe our preſent troubles, they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced our peace and quiet, and provoked but little to the practice of true godlineſſe and honeſty; the Lord in his good time touch the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the ſeeds-men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We expreſſe <hi>our honour and feare to God,</hi> by our <hi>full and perfect obedience to his will and word;</hi> ſo muſt we to our Soveraigne, by our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his <hi>Perſon and Lawes,</hi> preferring none but God before him; the firſt in <hi>Authority</hi> muſt alwaies command our firſt obedience, God that gives <hi>Authority</hi> to the King is therefore the greateſt, and ſo to be firſt obeyed; the King gives <hi>Authority</hi> to all inferiour Magiſtrates, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:155912:17"/> therefore is greater then all they, (both <hi>diviſim &amp; conjunctim</hi>) and ſo before them to be preferr'd in our ſubmiſſion unto, ſhould they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing contrary to his will. If it be ſaid: but ſuppoſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Magiſtrate commands according to the Kings Law, which is his revealed will, then 'tis lawfull not onely to diſobey his perſon, but alſo to make reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: This objection ſhall be dealt withall anon; onely for the preſent I ſay this, God is not honoured by <hi>being reſiſted,</hi> no more ſurely is the King. Moreover, <hi>Authority</hi> is rather rooted in the Prince then in his Law, for as he gives beeing to the <hi>inferiour Magiſtrate,</hi> ſo he doth to the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelfe, making it authorizable; <hi>Et propter quod aliquid eſt tale, illud eſt magis tale,</hi> He is greater therefore then his Law, &amp; not to be reſiſted for the ſake of that; which may be evidenced farther thus, if when the Prince commands any thing contrary to the revealed will of God, who hath given him his power, he is not to be reſiſted, though not to be obeyed; then much leſſe when he commands any thing contrary to his owne Law, to which himſelfe hath given power. Chriſtian Religion hath hitherto taught, that the Prince his will muſt alway be done <hi>of us,</hi> or <hi>on us; of us,</hi> when 'tis according to, or not againſt the Word of God; <hi>on us,</hi> when contrary to the ſame; we muſt one way or other ſubmit to <hi>Authority,</hi> to the <hi>penalty</hi> if not to the <hi>command;</hi> nor doe I conceive how I diſobey the Law of the Land, by ſubmitting to the penalty annexed in obeying the will of the Prince, ſeeing I muſt honour his perſon by my obedience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We doe manifeſt <hi>our reverence to God by our manner of addreſſe into his preſence,</hi> we doe not uſe to carry our Petitions to God with our hands upon our ſwords, nor goe to him with threats and armes to have our requeſts granted; neither muſt we in that faſhion repaire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our <hi>Soveraigne:</hi> nor doe we uſe to thinke to make God yeild unto us, by fore reporting of him that he meanes to doe ſo and ſo, that we might force him for his credit ſake to doe the contrary: but we goe to him with ſelfe-denying hearts and words, confeſſing his goodneſſe and our owne unworthineſſe, intreating him to take advantage of our neceſſities, to manifeſt his owne free grace, and to cauſe his owne glory to appeare, and after ſuch a manner, and with ſuch termes muſt we goe unto our King; the <hi>humble way</hi> is <hi>Gods way,</hi> which he will make ſucceſſefull.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:155912:18"/>5. We honour God <hi>by our unfeigned and conſtant love unto him,</hi> and for his ſake to thoſe that love him, or that he loves; which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by our ſpeaking good of him and them, and not by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his or their diſgrace and ruine. And ſo muſt we alſo <hi>ſhew our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> to our Prince by our love, which muſt be unfeigned and conſtant, both to <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his</hi> in all conditions; we muſt be willing rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his and their ſakes, then to countenance any evill againſt either. Indeed our love to our King will be thus natured, if it be rightly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, namely on Gods command, and becauſe he is our Soveraigne: for though indeed we are to pray that a Prince may alwayes be as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in grace and goodneſſe above others, as he is in dignity; yet if he be not, we muſt remember, that we owe him the higheſt honour as he is <hi>the Lords Anointed,</hi> and appointed of God to be our Governour; God who hath deſerved from us to be obeyed, hath commanded us <hi>to honour and love our King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed a Chriſtian is <hi>Homo per ſe,</hi> and hath a foundation for his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and love peculiar to himſelfe; he loves not his father onely becauſe he begat him, or his mother becauſe ſhe bare him in her wombe, and gave him ſucke, or his friend becauſe beneficiall unto him, or his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne becauſe he doth protect him: theſe are vulgar grounds, and of meere naturalls, yea of bruit creatures, but his principall foundation is the <hi>Command of God,</hi> and the apprehenſion of Gods love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and as Gods Love and Word is capable of no alteration, no more is a Chriſtians love and duty which is built upon it, it is in its meaſure and degree like that, conſtant, and unfeigned: yea, though the Prince ſhould change and omit what belongs to him, yet a true Chriſtian Subject changeth never, nor dareth he to neglect the leaſt tittle of his duty. O, ſayes he, Gods love to me in Jeſus Chriſt hath kindled in my heart a love unto my <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> ſet over me by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Gods word in my ſoule is the root of my duty to my <hi>Prince,</hi> therefore ſo long as God continues to love me, ſo long will I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue an obedient Subject, as nothing can ſeparate Gods love from me, <hi>neither life, nor death, nor Principalities, nor Powers;</hi> ſo nothing ſhall ſeparate my heart from my <hi>King;</hi> neither feares, nor threatnings, nor plunderings, nor perſecutions: as nothing can nullifie Gods word. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhall paſſe away, before the leaſt tittle of that ſhall periſh:</hi> ſo nothing can or ſhall alienate me from my <hi>Allegiance to my Prince,</hi> but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:155912:18"/> him will I Honour, him will I love, feare, and obey, actively or paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, although he ſhould account of me and deale with me as with an Enemy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We <hi>Honour God by rejoycing his Spirit,</hi> and by being carefull not to greive the ſame: after which manner alſo we muſt <hi>Honour the King:</hi> our endeavours muſt be to <hi>glad his heart,</hi> and our ſtudies to make him chearfull, that ſo he may govern us with comfort,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> and give <hi>up his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with joy,</hi> which will be moſt for our advantage, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in another caſe.</p>
               <p>Indeed croſſeneſſe and perverſneſſe is a great wickedneſſe when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed againſt any, ſpecially againſt a Prince, yet even ſuch a Perſon is ſometime ſo afflicted: <hi>When I ſpeake of Peace</hi> (ſaies King David) <hi>then they make them ready to battaile,</hi> ſuch was their croſſeneſſe:<note place="margin">Pſ. 120.7.</note> &amp; in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, <hi>they dealt perverſely with me, without a cauſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 119 78.</note> indeed when ever men deale perverſely with their Prince, they do ſo without cauſe, for there neither can, nor ought to be any cauſe to move a man to break his duty to his Sovereigne, or rather to his God who hath commanded his conſtant and loyall obedience.</p>
               <p>It is not ſpoken in Scripture to the commendation of thoſe vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Sonnes of Zerviah,</hi> that they were too hard for <hi>David,</hi> and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten greived his Spirit; but every true <hi>David</hi> muſt meet with ſuch men, to diſcover him to the reſt of his people, to be a man after Gods owne Heart, meeke, wiſe, and patient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (as ſome write) having got pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the <hi>Empreſſe,</hi> did vex <hi>Ioh.

               <p>Thus (reverend Sir) by this glimpſe you ſee what kind of Honour I believe is due unto a <hi>King,</hi> and how the Subjects are to expreſſe the ſame, and now Sir I inſtance not in every particular way, as in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tribute or the like, which our Savior and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth; becauſe that will naturally follow upon that which hath been ſaid.

               </p>
               <p>I then deſired to maintaine, and indeed do ſtill believe, that to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the <hi>King</hi> commands we muſt either yeild <hi>our active obedience,</hi> or (if againſt Conſcience,) we muſt <hi>ſuffer, or fly:</hi> you added a fourth, (which I did not acknowledge,) and you called it <hi>defenſive reſiſtance:</hi> And your poſition was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A defenſive reſiſtance againſt the Kings will or Perſonall commands when contrary to his legall, is lawfull, yea neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make good this poſition, there was (to prove the lawfulneſſe) alleadged the Example of the <hi>peoples reſiſting Saul</hi> in the behalfe of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> of <hi>Davids ſtrengthening</hi> himſelfe againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> of <hi>Davids purpoſe at Keilah,</hi> if the men therof would have ſtood unto him, of <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Arguments from reaſon alſo were produced, or rather ſimilitudes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Arguments (which I ſuppoſe were to ſhew the neceſſity of it) as of reſiſting <hi>a father</hi> or <hi>maſter,</hi> commanding by unjuſt violence things unlawfull, and unſutable to his fatherly or maſterly relation.</p>
               <p>And then the <hi>Oath or Covenant</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> takes or makes at his Coronation was alleadged, as giving countenance to a defenſive reſiſtance on the Subjects part, if the Prince doth make a breach thereof.</p>

               <p>The practice of ſome in this ſinfull Nation, doth at this preſent too too ſufficiently expound what is to be underſtood by the terme of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive reſiſtance:</hi> but I confeſſe their expoſition is very new, or els 'tis figurative, per <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>To defend of old, and properly, was and is to keep of, or to avoyd, not to give blowes; not to <hi>begin the aſſault:</hi> but it inferres an Aſſault made, &amp; <hi>a ſtaying at home</hi> rather then a going abroad, or a being driven from thence, rather then a driveing, it is not <hi>to hunt or</hi> purſue from place to place, but it preſuppoſeth a being hunted or purſued: and I ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take the terme in its ancient and prer ſignification, as perhaps you would have mee thinke you take it, (as being the more gentle,) then in that new ſenſe which this boiſterous Age doth: I conceive by a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive reſiſtance, an <hi>active reſiſtance by divers renouncing paſſive obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againſt the Kings will or perſonall command,</hi> if they that maintaine this poſition, be of the privy Councell to this reſiſting generation, we may ſuſpect two things from theſe their words, if they doe not flander.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the preſent war is not principally againſt thoſe that are with the <hi>King,</hi> as the common people are made to believe, but rather againſt the <hi>Kings</hi> owne Perſon: Indeed that voice, to fight againſt the <hi>King,</hi> would call together but little money, and few men in this Nation; nor can all that looke that way, hope to weare the <hi>Kings</hi> Crown; but they may promiſe to themſelves a portion in the eſtates of the <hi>Kings</hi> friends, who if he periſh (which God defend) are ſure to fall with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this warre is not to defend Religion, as the ignorant alſo are perſwaded, <hi>but onely to croſſe the King;</hi> that he might not have His will: Indeed the great and onely Controverſie between God and man is, whoſe will ſhall be done; no marvell if a good <hi>King</hi> be in Gods Condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againſt the Kings Perſonall will, when it contradicts his Law:</hi> I ſuppoſe the reaſon is, becauſe we muſt love the <hi>Law,</hi> better then we do the <hi>King</hi> the fountain of it: but how if the <hi>Kings will</hi> be concurrent with His <hi>Law?</hi> how if he not onely proteſts he will, but actually doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:155912:20"/> his <hi>ſacred Perſon</hi> to defend <hi>his Law?</hi> I hope in ſuch a caſe, it will be yeelded without diſpute, that reſiſtance is unlawfull, becauſe haply it would be ſuſpected, that thoſe that make it, do beare as ill an Affection to the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelfe, (as fearing a triall by it) as they do unto the <hi>King,</hi> (who would bring them to it.)</p>
               <p>But that is not our caſe you'l ſay, if you mean that which your ſelf have put, I grant the caſe concernes not us: but why then is the poſition of <hi>lawfull reſiſtance</hi> now preached? do any purpoſe in aftertimes to get their King into a ſtreight, and ſo force in him ſome breach of Law, to gaine advantage of <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> and therefore would have people by this doctrine ready prepared before hand, to aid them againſt him on the ſuddaine without ſcruple: well, yet I hope the Conſciences of true Proteſtant Subjects will never ſwallow this principle.</p>
               <p>But concerning the Poſition, I conceive 'tis built partly upon that diſtinction already diſliked as improper, ſpecially for Subjects to make uſe of, it being indeed of evill and dangerous conſequence: namely, that a King may be conſidered as <hi>a man</hi> without his office, and as <hi>a King</hi> in his office: for in an <hi>Hereditary Kingdome</hi> the Kings <hi>right to Regality</hi> was at the <hi>beginning of his Perſonality,</hi> they were borne and they die together, and therefore not ſo much as <hi>ly</hi> Subjects to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered aſunder. Indeed the King himſelfe may uſe this diſtinction in the caſe of pardoning thoſe that offend <hi>his perſon</hi> as he is a Chriſtian, he may forgive, (for he is not borne a Chriſtian though a Prince) but thoſe that offend him as he is <hi>Pater Patriae</hi> (as by ſtirring up Rebellion in the Common-wealth, and by ſhedding the bloud of his innocent Subjects) he muſt puniſh <hi>in regard of his office:</hi> I confeſſe 'tis a ſinne of a purple dye to offend the <hi>perſon</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> but true magnanimity can pardon great faults, ſpecially when none is offended thereby but he that pardons.</p>
               <p>Againe, I conceive the diſtinction betweene the Kings <hi>perſonall and legall command,</hi> is of no ancient ſtanding in the School of Chriſtianity; <hi>Faction</hi> bred it, and <hi>Sedition</hi> (if let alone) will nourſe it; it hath been already the mother of much ſtrife, and I pray God it prove not the Grandmother to confuſion: but admit it good, yet I doe not ſee how it belongs to Subjects to determine of the Princes <hi>will,</hi> to be contrary to his <hi>Law,</hi> whenſoever to outward appearance it ſeemeth ſo: God (ſayes <hi>Job) giveth not account of his matters,</hi> no more doe Princes

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> of the poſition it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>There is a difference made, or rather coyned, betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>His Law;</hi> and the Authors thereof ſay, <hi>It is lawfull to reſiſt the King to keep his Law, yea neceſſary:</hi> as if not <hi>obeying and reſiſting</hi> were both one, or muſt of neceſſity goe together; the Apoſtle ſayes,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>They that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation;</hi> not they <hi>that doe not obey:</hi> doubtleſſe therefore there is a difference. I have alwayes thought paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience to be the <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian vertue</hi> betweene them, and ſurely ſo it is, unleſſe Rebellion of late hath tane it from its place, made a vice of it, and clapt it into priſon; Reaſon ſayes, that by an humble ſubmiſſion to the penalty, a man may deny obedience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, to the <hi>Perſonall</hi> as well as to the <hi>Legall</hi> commands of the Prince: if men obey not the <hi>Law</hi> when the <hi>King forbids,</hi> nor the <hi>Kings will</hi> where the <hi>Law inhibits,</hi> neither is reſiſted; had all the Nation beene of this mind, we had bad no fighting, though the <hi>Kings will</hi> had truly oppoſed <hi>his Law,</hi> as is pretended.</p>
               <p>But let them be (as ſome would have it) both one: you ſay 'tis lawfull to <hi>reſiſt the King to keepe his Law,</hi> and why not as lawfull (at leaſt as pious) on the other ſide <hi>to neglect</hi> (I ſay not <hi>to reſiſt) his Law, to obey him,</hi> when the thing commanded is not ungodly? if the <hi>King</hi> be greater then his <hi>Law,</hi> we may. Nay, if to obey the King be <hi>Gods
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:155912:21"/> Ordinance,</hi> and to obey the Law, but the <hi>Ordinance of man,</hi> it is our duty: Theſe two particulars I will briefly prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If the King be greater then his Law we may;</hi> for as was ſhewed before, the greater firſt muſt be obeyed, but the King is greater, for <hi>he</hi> hath a more immediate dependance upon God, then his <hi>Law</hi> hath; <hi>He</hi> is the fountaine of <hi>that,</hi> and not <hi>that</hi> of him: He is the <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> (as the Scripture ſtiles him) the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> or great <hi>Councell of Elders</hi> may prepare or fit the <hi>matter</hi> of the Law,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> but the <hi>King</hi> gives the forme or beeing to it, he ſets the ſtampe upon it, and ſo makes it authorize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whence 'tis called the <hi>Kings Law:</hi> And as he gives a <hi>beeing</hi> unto, ſo he may diſpenſe with his owne Law, or with a Subject for the breach thereof; but the Law hath not that power over the King, therefore <hi>the King is above his Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly I cannot apprehend how the Princes <hi>Will</hi> is more <hi>reſiſtable</hi> then his <hi>Law,</hi> unleſſe it were proved to be ſubordinate thereunto; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſayes, that rather his <hi>Law</hi> is ſubordinate to his <hi>Will,</hi> being that his <hi>Will</hi> makes his <hi>Law,</hi> and not this his <hi>Will.</hi> The <hi>Kings Perſon</hi> (from which (ſure) his <hi>Will</hi> is not excluded) as hath beene granted, is <hi>Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Legibus,</hi> freed from his owne Lawes; <hi>ſcil.</hi> from their coactive power, and is <hi>Obligatus tantùm vinculo pietatis,</hi> bound onely in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to have reſpect unto them, as they are or may be rules for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter direction; and for the breach of conſcience onely even <hi>we</hi> to God onely are accountable, and therefore (ſure) the <hi>King</hi> by us in ſuch a caſe is not <hi>reſiſtable.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. If <hi>to obey the King be Gods ordinance, and to obey the Law be but the ordinance of man,</hi> then to obey the King in the firſt place is but our duty:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.7.</note> but this is evident, Gods word which is unalterable, ſayes, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the King;</hi> whereas 'tis onely an humane conſtitution which is revokeable, (and perhaps to morrow) that ſayes, obey ſuch or ſuch an Order, which is contrary to the Kings minde: now whether it be our <hi>duty to obey God or man,</hi>

                  </label> I anſwer: If I did beleeve Gods will were ſubordinate to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples appetite in the choice of a King, that he onely ſubmitted (as ſome are pleaſed to ſpeake) to their Election, with his conſent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I might haply be induced alſo to be of that opinion, concerning <hi>His word:</hi> but (as my judgement is) I neither can, nor dare conceive ſo meanely of Gods Word, as to thinke it in this caſe onely ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the precepts of men, to account it no more then a bare <hi>Copula</hi> betweene <hi>humane Lawes</hi> and <hi>mens conſciences,</hi> when as rather it is, or ought to be the foundation of, and guide unto both.</p>
               <p>I doe finde and feele that Gods Word tyes my conſcience to obey every one of the Kings commands (that are not againſt piety) yea his <hi>Perſonall,</hi> as well as his <hi>Legall,</hi> and <hi>thoſe</hi> firſt in caſe of difference: nor doe I (for my part) obey the Kings <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe it is eſtabliſhed, or becauſe of its knowne penalty annexed, nor yet the King himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he rules according to his Law; theſe are not my grounds of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but I obey the Kings <hi>Law</hi> becauſe I obey the Kings and I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the King, becauſe I obey God; I obey the King and his Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of God and his Law, which I hold to be the beſt obedience, and that of a Chriſtian man: when the feare of the Maſter makes the Scholler obey his precept, it is better then when the feare of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept makes him obey his Maſter: ſo when the reverend and loving regard of the <hi>Prince</hi> makes us <hi>obey his Law,</hi> 'tis better then when feare of <hi>the Law</hi> makes us obey <hi>the Prince.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:155912:22"/> but about active and <hi>violent reſiſtance</hi> againſt the one, in behalfe of the other, which I believe is unlawfull againſt either: becauſe the <hi>Kings Authourity</hi> goes with both: you deny the lawfulneſſe of reſiſtance againſt the <hi>Legall Commands,</hi> although ungodly, becauſe eſtabliſhed, (for here, ſay you, comes in paſſive obedience.)

               <p>Beſides, if it be unlawfull by violence to <hi>reſiſt Kings,</hi> or to defend our ſelves by Armes againſt them, when they command contrary to Gods Lawe, my reaſon cannot reach how it agrees with Chriſtianity to lift up the hand againſt them, when they command onely againſt their owne, ſure mans Lawes ought not to be dearer to us then Gods, nor our <hi>owne wealth</hi> more precious then <hi>Gods truth.</hi>

               <p>The ſecond is of <hi>Davids</hi> ſtrengthening himſelfe againſt <hi>Saul.</hi> To which I anſwer, that I finde not in Scripture that <hi>David</hi> ever ſtrooke up the Drum, or uſed any meanes to call or gather men unto him for any ſuch end; indeed 'tis ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 22.2.</note> that <hi>many that were afflicted</hi> (as he was) <hi>gathered themſelves unto him, and he became their Captaine,</hi> ſo that properly he ſtrengthened not himſelfe, they rather ſtrengthened him, or the Lord by them preſerved him for that imployment whereunto he was appointed: But doe we ever reade of any act of hoſtility that <hi>David</hi> with them did exerciſe againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> or againſt any of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, ſo long as <hi>Doeg</hi> was in favour, they might well pretend that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:155912:24"/> the King had <hi>ill Councellours about him,</hi> yet we reade not of any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that was uſed to remove them: Nay, very eaſily might <hi>David</hi> have revenged himſelfe upon the <hi>Ziphites,</hi> that did their good will to betray him into <hi>Sauls</hi> hand, if his conſcience would have ſerved him to kill any of the Kings Subjects, againſt the minde of the King.</p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay, that you gather from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. that <hi>David</hi> was 40000 ſtrong in the dayes of <hi>Saul;</hi> and 'tis probable he did not lie ſtill with his great Army. I anſwer, it is not apparent that all thoſe Captaines mentioned in that Chapter, brought all their men with them: yet if it were ſo, it makes againſt you; that <hi>David</hi> being ſo ſtrong, ſhould alway flee from <hi>Saul</hi> when purſued by him, and reſiſt never, much leſſe ſeeke after him; ſhould get him out of <hi>Sauls</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with ſo many men following him, and beg a place to dwell in of <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of <hi>Gath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (Sir) the truth is, <hi>David</hi> was never above 600 ſtrong, till about the time that <hi>Ziglag</hi> was burnt, which was about the time of <hi>Sauls</hi> death, and that great concourſe of men mentioned, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. came then to him, it may be probable that they fled from the battaile where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Saul</hi> was ſlaine; for the Text ſayes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. ſome of them helped <hi>David againſt the Rovers:</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 22, 23. 'tis ſaid, <hi>They came to him to turne the Kingdome of Saul to him, according to the word of the Lord.</hi> It was well knowne in <hi>Iſrael</hi> that <hi>David</hi> was appointed to ſucceed <hi>Saul,</hi> and who will not (at ſuch a time) looke to the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing: Thus to my apprehenſion the ſecond example is as farre from the marke, as the former. (Beſide <hi>David</hi> being an extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, full of Gods ſpirit, and by unction deſigned of God unto the Kingdome, his example in ſuch a caſe is not proper.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sam. 23.</note>The third you alleadged is the buſineſſe at <hi>Keilah:</hi> It is ſuppoſed (ſay you) that <hi>David</hi> would have defended that Towne againſt the King, if the Inhabitants would have beene faithfull to him: <hi>ergo.</hi> 'Tis lawfull to reſiſt the King, and to keepe his Townes againſt him.</p>
               <p>We uſe to ſay, <hi>à facto ad jus non valet conſequentia;</hi> indeed this was not <hi>factum,</hi> yet I ſee not how it followes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is ſo ſuppoſed,</hi> but not by every body, for ſome may (and perhaps as ſimply) ſuppoſe becauſe 'tis ſaid afterward,<note place="margin">Chron. 12.1.</note> that <hi>David kept himſelfe cloſe in Ziglag</hi>) that he would alſo here have lien cloſe in <hi>Keilah,</hi> if the men thereof would (as <hi>Rahab</hi> did the ſpyes) but have concealed him.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:155912:24"/>
               <p>But by the way here is one thing notable; <hi>David</hi> it ſeemes though he was 600 ſtrong in that Towne, would not venture upon it for to hold it, untill he knew whether he ſhould have the good will of the Inhabitants, he did not ſeize upon it on the ſuddaine, whether the King and they would or no, before they were aware, and keepe it by force againſt both, robbing, killing, and plundering his fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>But to the place: the Text ſayes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 23.9</note> that <hi>David knew that Saul ſecretly practiced miſchiefe againſt him,</hi> and thereupon fearing ſome treachery in the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> if he ſtayed there, being in a great ſtreight, <hi>He asked counſell of God</hi> about the matter, and the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him accordingly, and this was all the buſineſſe: But if you will ſuppoſe further that <hi>David</hi> had a purpoſe to have kept the Towne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, if the Citizens would have ſtood to him; I hope it may be lawfull for me to ſuppoſe alſo, that the Lord (whoſe counſell was asked) both could and would have inclined their hearts to have beene faithfull, if the thing purpoſed had beene lawfull; but Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſpeakes to my apprehenſion his diſallowance of it, and ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it did to <hi>Davids,</hi> as appeares by his departure, and his never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any ſuch matter afterward: if the anſwer of God had been cleane contrary to what it was, or ſuch as might in any ſort have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced his ſtay, there had beene ſome colour to have alleadged this ſtory for this matter of reſiſtance; but Gods wiſedome would not have any ſuch example upon record in his Word, he fore-ſaw that they, who are ſo bold upon a bare ſuppoſition, would have beene more bold (if more could be) upon a plaine example, Gods anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſuch, that all may underſtand (if they pleaſe) his refuſall of a bleſſing upon ſuch an enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>If it be yet urged upon me farther, as was before the Committee; what I thinke <hi>David</hi> would have done, if he had ſtaid in <hi>Keilah</hi> till <hi>Saul</hi> came; I muſt make the ſame anſwer as I did then: what <hi>David</hi> would have done I cannot tell, but I ſuppoſe the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would have done to him as the men of <hi>Abell</hi> did to <hi>Sheba</hi> afterward, (even cut off his head, and throwne it o're the wall) had the King came, or ſent for to demand it: But truly I wonder that the example of <hi>David</hi> ſhould be alleadged in this caſe of fighting againſt the King, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> on the Subjects part, if the Prince ſhall make a breach thereof, we ſhall a little conſider.</p>
               <p>Firſt (Sir,) let me minde you: of what you yeilded, namely, that the <hi>King</hi> is <hi>King</hi> before his <hi>Coronation;</hi> indeed his Crowne is but a note or enſigne of his Kingly dignity, he hath a right unto, and is in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall poſſeſſion of his Inheritance given him of God, before he makes his Covenant on the Coronation day, which cannot therefore be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be <hi>conditionall</hi> with the people; nor be thought that he by it from them receives his office with a <hi>quandiu bene ſe geſſerit,</hi> ſo that of neceſſity he muſt forfeit his power unto them, if he breakes his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>We read that ſupreme Princes in ancient times, as they were free from <hi>Lawes,</hi> ſo from <hi>Oathes;</hi> the Romane Empire was not wont to ſweare unto the Senate, or to the people, but they both did take an <hi>Oath</hi> to him. Thoſe <hi>Oathes</hi> &amp; <hi>Covenants</hi> the Scripture mentions in the Story of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> were not made or taken by the <hi>King,</hi> (if we marke them) but by the people to their <hi>King;</hi> or by the <hi>King</hi> and people together, unto the Lord, after ſome generall defection from his worſhip and ſervice: no, this cuſtome of a <hi>Kings</hi> ſwearing, is the Infant of later times, it was borne <hi>ad faciendum fidem,</hi> peoples di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt was the parent of it: evill ſuſpicion (as being for the moſt part the root of Rebellion) was ever counted ominous; and therefore to prevent a ſiniſter opinion of a new <hi>King</hi> it was thought meet by ſuch Princes, upon their ſolemne Coronation day, to enter into a viſible <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, in the preſence of their people.</p>
               <p>And I beleive the cuſtome's good as a meane (by Gods grace) to keepe a Prince his <hi>will,</hi> within the bounds of <hi>Conſcience:</hi> but (in that it was not ſo <hi>ab initio,</hi>) it plainly ſhewes that a Kings entrance into his Government, doth no whit depend upon his <hi>Covenant,</hi> nor doth this <hi>Covenant</hi> at all diminiſh his ſupremacy, or derogate from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe of his Power: no, if it were made unto his people, as it is not, I do not ſee how of neceſſity it muſt make him any way liable to their ſubjection, God himſelf was pleaſed <hi>ad faciendam fidem</hi> to ſwear
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:155912:29"/> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to <hi>David,</hi> yet did hee not thereby any way make himſelfe their inferiour.</p>
               <p>But indeed the Kings Oath and Covenant, is onely unto God, 'tis <hi>His Oath of Allegiance</hi> to the Lord; and in effect to this purpoſe, that he will diſcharge the truſt impoſed upon him by the God of Heaven and earth, of whom he holds his Kingdome; and this is made viſibly in the preſence of the people, that they might not diſtruſt the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or integrity of that Perſon, to whom is committed (by him who knowes all hearts) ſo great a Power.</p>
               <p>And ſure, as 'tis a heavy ſinne in a Prince to falſify his <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Majeſtie of Heaven,</hi> ſo 'tis no ſmall ſinne in Subjects to diſtruſt a Prince his <hi>fidelity</hi> upon ſlight grounds, or to expoſe him by any means to the generall ſuſpicions of his people.</p>
               <p>But now, (Sir) what warrant have the Subjects from hence for their reſiſtance, if the <hi>King</hi> breakes his <hi>Oath</hi> to God? is not God able to revenge his owne cauſe? hath hee not alwayes done it? obſerve ſtories, and ſee if you can name one example of any King, though never ſo great, that brake <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, whom God hath not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and is his arme ſhortned? or is not his Juſtice ſtill the ſame?</p>

               <p>But this I know, and wil be bold to ſay, as a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, that a Parliament (take it in either ſenſe) though it may do what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men may not do, yet it muſt not do, what a Chriſtian ought not to do: I beleeve that the Members of that Honourable Court, are Chriſtian men, &amp; that their duty is in the midſt of their State Affaires, to remember their relation to Chriſt, and to do nothing contradicting the ſame, for it will be no ſufficient excuſe, when he ſhall come to judge both quicke and dead, and charge any of them for breaking his Law, to ſay <hi>I did it as J was a Parliament man, and not as I was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> for if the Parliament man be puniſhed for his faults, I beleeve as a private man hee will feele the ſmart thereof: and ſo I conclude this particular, with my dayly prayer: <hi>Lord give to every member of that Honourable Court now Aſſembled, a full meaſure of thy grace, that they may be willing and ready to comply with his Sacred Majeſtie, their Gracious Sovereigne, and thine Anointed, in all thoſe wayes that tend to thy Glory, and the peace of this Church and Commonwealth: Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>and that in regard of the oath of God: i. e.</hi> that oath of Alleage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or ſubjection which in the name of God with his approbation Subiects have allwaies taken unto their Soveraignes, and whereunto God is a witneſſe, and whereof (if broken) he will be a ſevere puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher. <hi>Be not haſty to go out of his ſight:</hi> that is, ſaies Tremelius, <hi>ne ab obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quio illius te ſubducito animo perturbato,</hi> withdraw not thy ſelfe from his alleagiance in a diſcontentedneſſe of ſpirit: <hi>ſtand not in an evill thing,</hi> ſcilicet, <hi>in perturbatione &amp; rebellione quae tibi malum allatura eſſet,</hi> in thy ſullenneſſe and rebellion which will bring miſcheife upon thee, <hi>for hee doth what ever pleaſeth him;</hi> it is not thy will and pleaſure but the will and pleaſure of the Prince that muſt be done; Kings have long hands to reach thoſe that reſiſt them; and God doth inable them to have their Will upon ſuch treacherous and diſobedient Subiects as will not willingly ſubmit unto it.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>where the word of a King is, there is power;</hi> as to breake the

               <p>In the fourth place let me minde you of that in the firſt of <hi>Samuel, cap.</hi> 8. the 9 and following verſes: God having a purpoſe to give <hi>Iſrael</hi> a King, doth order ſo in his wiſedome that they ſhould make ſute for him themſelves; whereupon he takes occaſion by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in that place, to forewarne them of ſome intolerable qualities that might fall to be in ſome of their <hi>Kings,</hi> and thereby doth timely prepare them to obedience and patience under them: if we marke, there is as great injuſtice and tyranny foretold as could be imagined, their ſonnes, daughters, and ſervants, ſhould be taken from them; thoſe that were noble and free borne ſhould be made ſlaves, and put to ſervile offices, their lands and goods ſhould be extorted from them, and diverted to his owne and his Courtiers private uſe and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which were as great breaches of the Lawes of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> as any could be made, yet no reſiſtance in the caſe is countenanced, but countermanded rather, the onely courſe preſcribed is <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>You ſhall cry unto the Lord in that day,</hi> as if he had ſaid, be as weary as you will, or as you have cauſe, yet you ſhall not have leave to ſhake off the yoake which God through your importunity hath layed upon you, it ſhall not be lawfull for you to reſiſt or oppoſe by force theſe perſonall and unjuſt courſes of your King; but you <hi>ſhall onely cry unto God:</hi> as you <hi>cryed for a King,</hi> ſo ſhall you <hi>cry</hi> under a <hi>King,</hi> and till eaſe and helpe comes unto you this way; you muſt ſubmit to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:155912:36"/> extremities that his illegall will ſhall impoſe upon you: It is to be remembred, that this was at the firſt erection of a King among Gods people, and all Scripture being written for our Learning, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this is chronicled in Gods booke for the inſtruction of all Subjects that ſhould acknowledge and feare the Lord in after times. And moſt fitly alſo for the good of poſterity did Gods providence and ſpirit ſtrengthen this preſcription by recording the example of <hi>Davids</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage toward that their firſt King: for as <hi>Saul</hi> diſcovered in part the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed manners of ſuch a King as <hi>Samuel</hi> had ſpoke of, ſo <hi>David</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the preſcribed conditions of ſuch a Subject as God approves off: It is well knowne how unjuſtly and illegally he was perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> and how he avoyded his fury, onely by flying from place to place; he did not hunt the King, the King hunted him: He in all his ſtreights did cry to God, and truſted in his providence, and he loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it, God wrought for him better then he could have done for himſelfe; and did him more good then e're his owne reſiſtance could have done him: 'tis worthy our ſpeciall remembrance, how God provided for his eſcape in the wilderneſſe of <hi>Maon,</hi> when he was ſo encircled about with <hi>Saul</hi> and his men, that of neceſſity he muſt be killed, if he did not ſtand upon his owne defence;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 23.27.</note> but God would not ſuffer a good Subject to have a hand in ſo ſinfull a buſineſſe, or to leave ſo evill an example to after-times, and therefore his providence ſends a meſſenger to tell <hi>Saul</hi> that the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> had invaded his Land, whereby he was on the ſudden forced to be gone, and ſo <hi>David</hi> was delivered.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 29.</note> Likewiſe at another time when <hi>David</hi> was in as great a ſtreight, namely, when he ſhould have gone out with <hi>Achiſh</hi> againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> the Lord did alſo deliver him: <hi>Achiſh</hi> had allowed him <hi>Zig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag</hi> to dwell in, (for <hi>David</hi> durſt not in conſcience poſſeſſe himſelfe of any Citie in <hi>Iſrael</hi> without the Kings leave, much leſſe hold it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will) and therefore that he might not offend, he fled the Kingdome, and God gave him favour in the eyes of <hi>Achiſh,</hi> an enemy to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> could not tell how in gratitude to deny <hi>Achiſh</hi> to goe out with him againſt their common enemy, and therefore fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a willingneſſe, but doubtleſſe in his ſpirit he cryed unto the Lord for his helpe, that he might not be forced to lift up his hand againſt his Soveraigne: whereupon the Lord moved the Princes of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> to diſlike of his being there, ſo that he and his men were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed:

               <p>If it be objected (as 'tis often in Pulpits alleadged) that the people in building that Temple in <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> time,<note place="margin">Nehem. 4.</note> did worke with their ſwords, and ſpeares, and bowes, and ſo did defend themſelves againſt their enemies: I anſwer, it is true; but they had the Kings leave ſo to doe, the King was on their ſide, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was ſtrengthened by the Kings ſpeciall authority; ſo that not they, but thoſe that oppoſed them, were the <hi>reſiſters of the King.</hi>

               <p>But (Sir) I will not weary your Spirit with the quotation of too many Scriptures of this nature, contradicting reſiſtance; I ſhall onely therefore remember you of two more, and then conclude this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar alſo; one is <hi>Act.</hi> 23. you cannot deny,<note place="margin">Act. 23.3, 4.</note> but when <hi>Ananias</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Paul</hi> to be ſmitten, it was a command <hi>contrary to Law,</hi> (for the Text doth ſo affirme it) hee had no ground but his owne will to offer that violence: and yet how doth the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> checke himſelfe, for his but ignorantly ſpeaking an unbeſeeming word againſt him? and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:155912:38"/> Scripture againſt himſelfe, <hi>it is written, thou ſhalt not ſpeake evill of the ruler of the people,</hi> and if that word Ruler did comprehend <hi>Ananias,</hi> I am ſure it includes the <hi>King,</hi> and if not an unbeſeeming word to ſuch a one, then ſure not a reſiſting action againſt a <hi>King,</hi> which is farre more unbeſeeming: if you ſay, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a private man, but what is his example to a publicke State, or Parliament? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, a publicke State conſiſts of private men; beſides, the Title of <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer,</hi> which they that walke in this way of reſiſtance are called by, doth ſpeake to my apprehenſion, that the Parliament doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any to run upon their owne damnation,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.2.</note> by going this way, but leaves it to every ones owne free will, and ſo in effect, all reſiſters are but private men: and (without offence be it ſpoken) I thinke Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> example in a matter of this nature, ſhould be more prevalent with a Chriſtian, then the very command it ſelfe (if ſuch a thing were) of a whole Parliament.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let the example of our Maſter and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt never be forgotten by us; who when apprehended in the Garden, would not ſuffer <hi>Peter</hi> to uſe his ſword in defence of him againſt authority, but told him, <hi>Hee that ſmit with the ſword</hi> (againſt that) <hi>ſhould periſh by the ſword</hi> (of that): and yet if you well conſider it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve you will confeſſe that that authority was rather guided by <hi>Will</hi> then <hi>Law,</hi> in that particular action: nay, and our Saviour addes too, that he was ſtrong enough to have defended himſelfe had it beene lawfull, for he could have had <hi>twelve Legions of Angels</hi> with a word ſpeaking: yea, the whole courſe of the proceedings againſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was illegall, for what Law was there ever that an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be delivered to the will of his accuſers to be crucified, yet the text ſayes of <hi>Pilate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 19.16.</note> that, <hi>Tradidit Jeſum voluntati eorum,</hi> it was mouth and malice onely that prevailed, yet our Saviour made no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; it cannot be ſaid that he was then onely as a private man, for ſure at that time he was (of all that ever was) the moſt publike perſon alſo; if it be ſaid, but his caſe was particular: I anſwer, true, but our Saviour did not ſinne in the manageing of it, as (for ought I ſee) he muſt have done, if he had omitted any thing that had beene law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and neceſſary; and ſuch (if we will beleeve it) is <hi>defenſive reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> againſt the perſonall and illegall commands of a Governour.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I doe not ſee how Chriſt can be freed from the imputation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:155912:38"/> of unfaithfulneſſe; if this doctrine of reſiſtance be ſo lawfull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a thing for the preſervation of a Chriſtian Church and State, (the matter being of ſuch grand importance) that he did not leave ſome expreſſe and plaine warrant for it: No, no, Chriſt was faithfull in all things, righteouſneſſe and peace, truth and love, humility and obedience met all in him, let his wayes onely be acknowledged ſafe and good, and ours confeſſed to be dangerous and ungodly.</p>
               <p>Thus (good Sir) you have my Scriptures againſt reſiſtance, from which (with many others of like nature) I doe conclude, That to the Prince his perſonall command, as well as to his legall, I muſt yeild mine active obedience, (if not againſt the revealed will of God) or elſe ſubmit with patience to the penalty that ſhall according to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be inflicted: or laſtly, I may flie for mine owne ſafety, if I have not a ſufficient meaſure of ſuffering grace. And I doe conclude, that by Gods Word reſiſtance is utterly unlawfull in this caſe, and that no man from thence can have a ſufficient ground for his conſcience to go in ſuch a way.</p>
               <p>And now (Sir) I could argue thus with you: If we muſt not by the rules of Divinity reſiſt the Kings will when it commandeth againſt his Law, then ſurely not when it concurres with his Law, not when it conteſts for his Law, not when the King adventures his ſacred perſon in defence of his Law, againſt thoſe that not onely ſtop all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Law, but directly breake all Lawes both of God and Man; ſuch are thoſe that pull downe Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, that, (ſlighting all oathes, duties, and relations) do murder, plunder, rifle, rob, and by violence take away all they can lay hold on, contrary to Law: I ſay, when the Kings perſonall Will concurres with his Lawes againſt ſuch perſons, then we are not to reſiſt him; I ſuppoſe your ſelfe will confeſſe it.</p>
               <p>Or againe from your owne poſition I could thus argue: If it be lawfull to reſiſt the perſonall will of a King, when it oppoſeth his Lawes (as you ſay); then ſure 'tis much more lawfull, and our duty, to reſiſt the perſonall commands of others when they oppoſe the Law, and the King too; And if the King be bound to alleadge an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Law for every thing he commands, or elſe may be reſiſted: ſure we have reaſon to looke that others ſhould produce an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Law for all that they require at any of our hands, or elſe we need
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:155912:39"/> not obey them, ſpecially againſt the King; even ſenſe and reaſon will make that conſequent: Thus (Sir) I could argue, but I will leave the <hi>Argumentation</hi> to your owne <hi>conſcience.</hi>

               <p>Rebellion is all kinde of evill, 'tis the Puddle of all ſinnes, the Sinke of all villany, the breach of all Lawes and relations both towards God and man: Pride, Prophaneſſe, Perjury, envy, wrath, malice, theft, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Cruelty, rapine, ſpoile, and oppreſſion, irreligion, and unnaturall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are all concenter'd in Rebellion, yea all ſinnes, by all names, that ſinnes can be named, and by all meanes that ſinnes can be committed do follow Rebellion, and are found among that diſordered and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſort of people, yea <hi>Rebellion</hi> is the ruine of <hi>Religion,</hi> Church and Common-wealth, of States, families, and men; 'tis <hi>monſtrum horren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, informe, ingens cui lumen ademptum,</hi> a moſt horrible, ugly, blind, il-favoured Monſter, quite void of the light of grace, or of Gods feare, what ever it pretendeth: Rebellion, ſaies the Spirit, <hi>is as the ſinne of witchcraft,</hi> though ugly and Diobolicall in it ſelfe, (for the Devill was the firſt Rebell) yet exceeding ſpecious and betwitching,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5.23.</note> becauſe masked commonly with Religion, and uſherd with pretences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: and therefore it is moſt odious unto God.</p>
               <p>I may well ſay of it, as the Apoſtle doth of fornication, <hi>'tis a ſinne not to be named among the Saints;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.3.</note> of which judgement (as may ſeeme) are others too, for let but a Miniſter (in theſe daies) pray or preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Rebellion,</hi> let him but ſay <hi>God needs it not to maintaine Religion,</hi> the very mention of the name <hi>Rebellion,</hi> makes him capable of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:155912:39"/> and liable unto puniſhment: Indeed <hi>Rebellion</hi> is the Devills ſin, and a ſin as bad as the devill himſelf, for 'tis the continent &amp; cauſe of all ſin, and no more can be ſaid of him; 'tis a ſinne that God hath as ſurely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as he hath the Devill; I could give you many examples hereof, but I ſpare you; onely know this, that for my part I reſolve with my ſelfe from theſe Conſiderations,<note place="margin">Pſ. 66.7.</note> that the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> prayer ſhall be ever mine (in private, ſince I am barr'd from the publicke) <hi>O Lord, thou that by thy power ruleſt for ever, whoſe eies behold the nations, let not the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious exalt themſelves.</hi>

               <p>Sir, it hath beene obſerved of ſome, that being maimed, have with much difficulty returned from <hi>Edge-hill</hi> Battaile, (where, if their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes fatherly bowels had not yearned with pitty towards them when they were taken, in regard of their ſimplicity, they had beene hanged according to their merits) when they have come for reliefe to the rich of the Pariſh, diſcovering their wounds, they have beene ſleighted with this Anſwer, <hi>Who bad you goe, Who bad you goe?</hi> now whom ſhall theſe poore afflicted cry out upon, but on the Preachers, whoſe ſeducing tongues wrought moſt upon their ignorance and good meaning? And alas, ſhould I be thus cruell to impoveriſh men, to lame their bodies, to defile their ſoules, to undoe them every way? the Lord keepe me from doing ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Abigail</hi> diſſwaded <hi>David</hi> from ſlaughtering <hi>Nabal</hi> and his family, ſhe uſed this Argument; <hi>Ne ſit in ſingultum cordis Domini mei in poſterum,</hi> leſt it be a corroſive to my Lords ſpirit afterward: and I profeſſe unto you I do beleeve, that had I beene at <hi>Edge hill</hi> (as ſome Miniſters were) againſt his Majeſtie, all the bloud that was there ſhed, would roare continually night and day in my conſcience; but the Lord I hope will ever preſerve the ſoule of his poore Miniſter, from the hearing of ſo hideous a cry.</p>
               <p>Nay (Sir) may it not be imagined that all the bloud that hath beene ſhed throughout the Land in this unchriſtian and unnaturall Warre, ſhall in the concluſion be charged upon the Miniſters heads, both by God and Man?

               <p>Sir, from theſe and ſuch like thoughts my reſolves are, as I told you at our laſt meeting, to endeavour by Gods grace to be able to ſay when I die, with S. <hi>Paul, I am free from the bloud of all men;</hi>

               <p>And yet (Sir) I hope you remember that I doe not goe all alone, ſome of my godly Brethren of the Miniſtry are of my judgement, who for their ability and faithfulneſſe in their calling, for their <hi>holineſſe</hi> and <hi>honeſty</hi> of life, have beene as well approved of, as any of the others when time was, although at this preſent they are diſcountenanced and defamed, for their bearing teſtimony to the truth of Jeſus, and their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull love unto their <hi>Soveraigne;</hi> ſome of whom (you know) I named unto you, and others I could name, but their bonds and impriſonments, their abuſes and reproaches, their being made the ſcorne of men and the outcaſts of the people doth ſave me that labour.</p>
               <p>But for the matter of example: Sir, I ſpeake it without flattery, (as God knowes) there are few whom I have deſired more to be like then your ſelfe, ſuch an high reverence have I alwayes had of thoſe graces and gifts which our rich God hath beſtowed upon you, which in his ſervice you have heretofore to my apprehenſion moſt faithfully and unweariably expended: and indeed I beleeve your bare example in this buſineſſe, hath ſwayed more with many of our Brethren in theſe parts of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> then their owne judgements: (if a man may gueſſe at their judgements by their former Doctrines) they have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to your eyes and ſhut their owne, againſt their former received

I have much wondred that among the late plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> there hath not beene ſome one to inhibit people this Blaſphemy and Idolatry, doubtleſſe it affords ſuſpicion of little true love to the <hi>firſt Commandement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, is not reverence in <hi>Gods Houſe</hi> and <hi>Service,</hi> with a due regard to his <hi>Miniſters</hi> in the execution of their office, required in the <hi>ſecond Commandement?</hi> (as well as Superſtition forbidden?) and yet we ſee, 'tis counted ranke Popery to be more reverend there then other men, and want of zeale not to abuſe Gods <hi>Miniſters;</hi> yea prophaneneſſe and misbehaviour in Gods worſhip, and oppoſition to his ſervants are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:155912:43"/> reckoned by ſome the beſt <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> I dare affirme it from what I have read, and now ſee; that no people in the world, not they that worſhip the Devill himſelfe, are ſo rude and unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their actions of this nature, and to the Miniſters of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſome of ours are at this preſent, and yet there is no Law to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them; nay, all Lawes are taken away (as they ſay) that were wont to reſtraine them: ſure (if this be ſo) 'tis a making void of the <hi>ſecond Commandement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And concerning the <hi>third,</hi> we have thoſe (and they in favour too) that not onely thinke it lawfull for themſelves to breake thoſe oathes which they have formerly made in the preſence and name of God, but alſo (having as may ſeeme as good a faculty as the Pope) to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the breach of them in others, and teach and exhort others thereunto as a thing neceſſary, ſo it be <hi>in ordine ad cauſam,</hi> (as the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites ſpeake) to promote the good cauſe. Surely (Sir) I am much deceived if this be not the higheſt contempt that can be offered to the <hi>third Commandement;</hi> if God were in earneſt when he made it, hee will never hold them <hi>guiltleſſe</hi> that doe ſuch things againſt it.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>fourth,</hi> I wonder how <hi>that</hi> of late hath loſt the favour of ſome of them, who foure or five yeares agoe were ready to venture all they had to maintaine the dignity of it, did they onely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to preſerve it till now, that it might periſh with its fellowes? or are all kinde of revellings or ſportings no ſinnes on the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> becauſe they are acted in this yeare of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> theſe bleſſed dayes of liberty (as they are called)? nay, are muſtering of men, (when there is no enemy nigh) plundering of men, murdering of men on the Lords Day, no violations of the Day? (it ſeemes ſo) for ſome of us on that day can exhort to nothing elſe: Surely (Sir) from preaching for, and approbation of ſuch doings, ſome will be ready to ſay, that we Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters indeavoured onely to preſerve the <hi>fourth Commandement</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that our ſelves might deſtroy it now; and our feare onely was, leſt any ſhould be injurious to God beſide our ſelves.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>fifth Commandement,</hi> is there any thing required in that, which this generation will acknowledge as a duty; any thing forbidden therein, which it will yeild to be a ſinne? the Author of the late <hi>exhortation to repentance</hi> (publiſhed to the whole Nation) doth inſtance in no one direct breach of the <hi>fifth Commandement,</hi> to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:155912:44"/> be confeſſed on the faſt day, indeed all bonds of duty and relation are preached aſunder to make way for liberty, the Subject may not onely reſiſt the <hi>King</hi> (ſaies the <hi>Weaver</hi> that is ſet up to preach in my Church) <hi>but alſo kill him in ſome caſes;</hi> and ſo the <hi>wife may kill her husband,</hi> and <hi>the childe may kill his father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and Surely Sir if ſuch preachers and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, muſt be forced upon a Miniſters people in ſpight of his teeth, I muſt needs feare that treaſon is hatching againſt the <hi>fifth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> we muſt bid farewell to that very ſhortly.</p>
               <p>And for the 6. which forbids <hi>murder,</hi> the Commiſſion to <hi>Kill, ſlay, and deſtroy,</hi> hath ſilenced that halfe a yeare ago, and he that kills moſt of the Kings beſt Subjects is thought worthy the beſt wages.</p>
               <p>And for the ſeventh which inhibits <hi>uncleanneſſe,</hi> that is out of date too, ſince the Courts to puniſh that ſin went downe, people thinke they may get as many Baſtards as they will or can; for Lawes (they ſay) are ſuppreſſed for this very end, to incourage them to take their Liberty more cheerefully.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>ſtealing, robbing, ſpoiling, rifling,</hi> violent taking away the goods of others, which are ſinnes againſt the <hi>eight Commandement,</hi> theſe (they ſay) they may do by an <hi>ordinance</hi> (a certaine thing above all Law) which though for my part I dare not beleeve, yet this I may ſay, the Land was never ſo full of theeves as now, and never leſſe force appeared in the Law to puniſh them.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>ſlandering</hi> (the breaches of the <hi>ninth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) they are the maine trade of the times, the very foundation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to preach againſt them, in ſome mens apprehenſion ſpeakes us enemies to that, I know who was ſent for, to the Parliament by a Purſevant, for no other cauſe (that he knows of) but only for preaching againſt <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>ſlandering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for Covetouſneſſe (which the <hi>tenth Commandement</hi> gives charge againſt) <hi>Publicke faith</hi> hath taken ſuch a courſe to procreate and enlarge that ſin, as never (I thinke) was practiced before, by its promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing payment out of the <hi>eſtates of Delinquents;</hi> which very device hath planted ſo much malice in mens hearts againſt thoſe they never ſaw, and ſo much covetouſneſſe of what is none of theirs, that many yeares paines in the Miniſtry will not be able to plucke up againe.</p>
               <p>Thus Sir, together with the King, the <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque tabulae,</hi> both Tables themſelves of the divine Law are oppoſed and reſiſted, all Gods
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:155912:44"/> moſt holy Commandements together with his ſervants, are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly made delinquents, <hi>&amp; collecta vitia per tot aetates diu in nos re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant ſimul.</hi> And ſhall we the Miniſters who are entruſted of God to defend his Lawes, conſent or provoke to theſe breaches of them, to this injuſtice to them?

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:155912:49"/> of theſe times: they boaſted that their ſide <hi>was an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtrong;</hi> and juſt that number do they boaſt of now; they went much upon blind propheſies, and had high conceipts of the merit of their owne faſtings and prayers, which is alſo the very fancy of this Generation; they defamed and belied the <hi>Queene</hi> that She was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> as theſe do our King: They ſtirr'd up the people to advance their way, and publiſhed this poſition among them, <hi>It is the multitude and common ſort that muſt bring this worke to paſſe,</hi> and is not this the tenent and practice of theſe times? They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured indeed to engage ſome of the Nobility and inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, with themſelves in the quarrell againſt the Queene and her Government, but thoſe were more wiſe and godly then to be ſo delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Now what the end of <hi>Hacket</hi> and his fellowes was, the ſtory tels us, and reaſon ſaies other mens harmes ſhould make us wary.</p>
               <p>Nay (Sir) I have alſo obſerved with diligence what <hi>Joſephus</hi> tels of the manners, waies, and words of the ſeditious in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when that City was deſtroyed by <hi>Titus Veſpatian,</hi> and finding the ſame ſo fully conſonant to the qualities of our reſiſting ſpirits, I confeſſe I have often feared the like Conſequence: I will name ſome few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars unto you, and leave them alſo to your owne thoughts and Conſcience for Application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were divided among themſelves, and would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to lay downe their hatred towards each other, yea they killed thoſe that moved thereto, and ſaid plainely <hi>we will not leave our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi> one was ſlaughtered but for making this prayer: <hi>O Lord plant among the children of Iſraell freindſhip and Brotherhood, take away from them this hatred that is riſen of nothing, &amp; let not the one prevaile againſt the other, ſeeing they be all thy ſervants and the children of thy Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They alſo at that time of diviſion fell off from their obedience to <hi>Caeſar</hi> who was their King; indeed they had beene brewing of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt in their purpoſes, many yeares before; as appeares by that advice of <hi>Agrippa</hi> unto them (mentioned by <hi>Joſephus) Be not haſty I beſeech you of Liberty: for many ſeeking Liberty have fallen into further Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and greater Bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It was a fault among them, not onely to be peaceable and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo to be rich; for the Captaines of the Conſpiracy with Cut-throats like themſelves, would lay hands on the rich men of the City, and ſpoile them of their goods pretending they had ſent letters to <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patian</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:155912:50"/> (their right Governour) to betray the City to him; which by the Teſtimony of godleſſe perſons of their owne Company, limbes of the Devill (as the Story calls them) they would prove, and thereupon ſpoile them of their goods, put them into priſon, and condemne them to death for Rebels.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They held the Judges in awe, threatening that unleſſe they did give ſentence upon thoſe they brought before them, they ſhould go themſelves the ſame way.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They were of ſuch contradictive ſpirits, that if any whom they perſecuted, did but requeſt ought at their hands, for that cauſe they would deny it: when <hi>Gorinion</hi> a good rich man, being condemned for his wealth, and his honeſty, deſired but buriall, they anſwered if he had not deſired it they would have granted it, but ſince he was ſo bold to aſke it, he ſhould not have it, and ſo threw his body being ſlaine unto the beaſts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They made one <hi>Pavi</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Peniell</hi> a Carterly Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (ignorant of what belonged to the Preiſts office) <hi>High Preiſt:</hi> for ſaies the Story, <hi>they held the Preiſthood and ſervice of God, but as toies, gaudes; and trifles,</hi> though they pretended that all they did was for it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When <hi>Joſephus</hi> (being ſent by <hi>Titus</hi> with promiſe of favour, if they would ſubmit) did make an Oration to them, diſſwading from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting <hi>Caeſar</hi> their <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> alleadging many <hi>Scriptures</hi> againſt their way, telling them withall that their fathers did never prevaile with ſpeare and ſhield, but with prayer, repentance, and pureneſſe of heart; inſtanceing in <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Moſes, David,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiah's</hi> examples: they did uſe all meanes that poſſibly they could, to doe him ſome miſchiefe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When <hi>Titus</hi> himſelfe, who for his ſweet diſpoſition was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Amor &amp; deliciae humani generis,</hi> the <hi>Carolus</hi> of that age; in pity to the poore ſeduced hunger-ſterved people, did with all compaſſion and promiſe of mercy, perſwade them not to ſuffer themſelves to be deſtroyed; they would not beleeve him, nor ſuffer the people to yeild unto him, but railed upon him, and abuſed him moſt ſhamefully, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring from the walls to doe him hurt: who for all this when hee heard of the number of their ſlaine, he would lift up his eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſay, <hi>'Tis well knowne to thee O Lord of Heaven, that I am not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:155912:50"/> the cauſe of theſe evils, for I deſired to be at peace with them oftner then once, but the ſeditious evermore would nothing but warre, warre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. They pretended in all their rebellion that they fought for the Lords cauſe, for the Law and Religion of their God: which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> had no purpoſe to debarre them of, nor indeed had they that ſo pretended, the leaſt ſparke of Gods feare in them, as appeares by the Proclamation of one of the Captaines to gather Souldiers together, which was in theſe words: <hi>Whoſoever liſteth to be rid of his Maſter, or hath received any injury, and deſires to be revenged, or that cannot abide the rule of any, or that is in debate or in feare of creditors, or that hath ſhed innocent bloud, or that lurketh in ſecret for feare of the Law; whoever is diſpoſed to rob and rifle, to doe injury or wrong, to haunt whores, to ſteale and murder, to eate and drinke at other mens coſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour of his owne hands; let him reſort unto me, and I will deliver him from the yoke and danger of the Lawes, and will finde him his fill of booties and ſpoyles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. They had their lying Prophets, that prophecied to the laſt, yea when the Temple was burnt, and divers of the obſtinate Prieſts had leapt into the fire; theſe Prophets ſtill ſtirr'd up the people to play the men, and to reſiſt their enemies, telling them, that the <hi>Temple</hi> ſhould be builded by it ſelfe without hands, that God would declare his power unto the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who now did glory in themſelves, that they had overcome the <hi>Jewes:</hi> and thus the poore people were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooled, partly by their <hi>ſeditious Captaines,</hi> and partly by their <hi>lying Prophets,</hi> untill the whole Nation in a ſort was ſlaughter'd, and that noble Citie quite deſtroyed: <hi>Deus nobis avertat omen.</hi> Sir, theſe thoughts have wrought with me.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This way of my Brethren <hi>is againſt our oath of Allegeance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Againſt our oath of Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</note> an <hi>Oath</hi> is a moſt ſacred and regardable thing; God the avenger is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by call'd to witneſſe the truth of our hearts in what we ſay, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: This <hi>Oath of Allegeance</hi> I have taken ſeaven or eight ſeverall times unto His Majeſtie; had it beene but once, I ſhould not dare to breake it: I remember that place in <hi>Ezekiell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 17. v. 15. ad 30.</note> where the Lord ſaith concerning the King and people of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (who had deſpiſed their oath of Allegeance, and broke their Covenant made to the King of <hi>Babylon) they ſhall not be delivered, they ſhall not eſcape</hi> ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; 'tis expreſſed over and over by the ſpirit, to ſhew how
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:155912:51"/> highly God is incenſed for ſuch a ſin, and though it was made unto an Heathen Prince, yet <hi>v.</hi> 19. the Lord calls it <hi>his Oath,</hi> becauſe made in his name and preſence (as all oaths are) and himſelfe ſweares, as hee lives, It ſhall be recompenced upon the breakers heads; and ſo it was moſt heavily: for as S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon the matter ſayes, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bique ignis graſſabatur Barbaricus, juramento ignem ducente, &amp; flammam paſſim circumagente;</hi> the <hi>Barbarian</hi> fire every where ſpoyled, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated oath led the fire, and carried the flame about from place to place: nor can I forget how that oath which was made to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſh. 9.</note> though on their parts obtained by fraud, was to be kept inviolably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſacred tye, and how the breach thereof was puniſhed afterward in <hi>Davids</hi> time, by three years famine, and the death of ſeaven of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſonnes: for that <hi>Saul</hi> to pleaſe the people to ſhew his zeale to them, had ſlaine the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> againſt the oath which his fore-fathers had made;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.2.</note> from whence we may learne 2 things: Firſt, That <hi>Princes</hi> may endanger their <hi>Poſterities</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes</hi> welfare, to the ſeverity of Gods diſpleaſure, by humouring their people in all things. Secondly, That the <hi>violation</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> though but once made, and by fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unto ſlaves and ſervants, ſhall be ſure by the Lord to be ſharpely puniſhed upon the violators, or their poſterity: and if ſo, then much more will God moſt ſurely avenge the wilfull breach of a Subjects oath, ſo often renewed and taken in Gods name and preſence unto his Soveraigne. Sir, we Miniſters were wont upon the Faſt dayes (when with our people we renewed our vowes &amp; covenants with the Lord) to declare the high danger and penalty of breach of oathes; and is it honeſt or comely for us now by our doctrines and examples, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute our former ſelves, and drive our poore ignorant ſheepe upon their aſſured deſtruction; God forbid that ever my ſoule ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Oppoſite to our late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.</note>But in the laſt place of all, this way of my Brethren <hi>directly oppoſeth our late Proteſtation,</hi> which I thinke my ſelfe bound in conſcience to keepe, ſo farre as lawfully I may: therein I promiſe to maintaine to the uttermoſt of my power, <hi>The Kings Majeſties Perſon, Honour and Eſtate;</hi> but if I goe in this way I muſt oppoſe His Majeſties Perſon, and (as it ſeemes) hold that 'tis lawfull to reſiſt His Perſonall will in behalfe of His Legall; (though <hi>this</hi> be not ſo much as mentioned in the Proteſtation); and I muſt (as others doe) extenuate His Name and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:155912:51"/> Honour, by venting confidently as truths what ever evill I heare of Him; I muſt be glad to heare that His eſtate is with-held from Him (as Himſelfe complaines) and imployed againſt Himſelfe: and I muſt hope (as others ſpeak) that meere poverty and neceſſity will at length make him humble himſelfe, and ſubmit unto his people. No (Sir) rather then I will thus willingly breake my Proteſtation, <hi>Let the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my perſecute my ſoule and take it, let him throw my life downe to ground, and lay my credit in the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not all, I muſt joyne to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> contrary to my Proteſtation too: for (Sir) I beleeve there be more points of <hi>Popery</hi> then one, Superſtition alone doth not make up the religion of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt;</hi> in this very way of yours are many tenents and points thereof, beſides a great deale of its practice: let me inſtance in a few of many particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doctrine of <hi>reſiſting Princes</hi> is a Doctrine of <hi>Popery,</hi> which is now maintained with ſword and ſpeare, and all weapons of warre; the <hi>Doctrine of calling Kings to account</hi> by their Subjects, was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Pope <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> the brat of his braine, he hatch'd it, and ſhall I breake my <hi>Proteſtation</hi> to ſet up Pope <hi>Hildebrand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is an <hi>infallibility</hi> of judgement in ſome men, is a point of <hi>Popery,</hi> and ſo it is that men may <hi>abſolve from oaths,</hi> and they are dangerous points too; the one is the ground of all errours in the <hi>Church,</hi> and the other the cauſe of all diſturbance in the <hi>State,</hi> and theſe two points are now preached and practiced by ſome of them that walke in the new way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To <hi>beleeve in the creature</hi> is a point of <hi>Popery,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay they beleeve in the Church; and I have heard His Majeſtie found fault withall, becauſe in his pious and convincing Declarations he ſayes, that he truſts in God, and in his providence: whereas (ſaid the fault finder) he ought to have ſaid, <hi>He truſted in His Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. No faith (ſayes the <hi>Papiſt</hi>) is to be kept with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (ſo they call good <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) no faith is to be kept with <hi>Malignants,</hi> ſay ſome amongſt us, (for ſo they call good Subjects:) <hi>Memento ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo quod Gibellinus es,</hi> remember friend you are a Royalliſt, was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent matter to condemne a man of old among them, and ſo 'tis now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Doctrine of merit</hi> is a <hi>Popiſh tenent,</hi> and is not that daily
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:155912:52"/> preached by ſome, unto thoſe that go forth in this warre againſt the <hi>King;</hi> even as the <hi>Friers</hi> of old were wont to promiſe ſalvation to all that promoted the warre of the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> to the <hi>Holy land,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Merindoll</hi> and <hi>Cabriers,</hi> ſo do ſome of our preachers warrant ſalvation, to all thoſe that die in this their cauſe, whereas Damnation is threatened unto the contrary parties.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Doctrine of <hi>Popery</hi> is a Doctrine of <hi>Lies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> what is their way of preaching but a telling of tales and <hi>lies,</hi> againſt thoſe whom they call Hereticks; and of the forged <hi>Miracles</hi> done by their owne Saints? and is not that the manner of thoſe Preachers that are for this new way? do they not fill their ſermons with fearefull <hi>tales</hi> of thoſe whom they count their Enemies, and <hi>with miracles</hi> (as it were) of thoſe on their owne ſide?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hath it not beene counted <hi>Popery,</hi> to preſſe the <hi>precepts of men</hi> with more eagerneſſe then thoſe of God, and to puniſh the neglect of them with greater ſeverity then the breach of divine Lawes? and may not men now a daies, breake the righteous Lawes of God, ſteale, rob, and ſpoile their neighbours, perſecute Gods Miniſters, prophane his worſhip and deface his houſes, with impunity, nay with commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their zeale and care of the cauſe? but if any for conſcience ſake forbeare to give a ready obedience to a burdenſome ordinance of man, which perhaps too he cannot poſſibly ſtand under, ſhall he not be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned and plundered, his living taken from him if he be a Miniſter, and his people poyſond with the intruſion of ſome falſe teacher?</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Doctrine of <hi>Popery</hi> is a Doctrine of <hi>Pride</hi> all muſt ſubmit to the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Popelings,</hi> he for his part will be judged by none, but all muſt be judged by him; from which condition, he is called by the Apoſtle <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> becauſe he advanceth himſelfe againſt <hi>all that is called God,</hi> which is the title of Kings and Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is not this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lativeneſſe of ſpirit manifeſt among us? nay do not our Brethren of the new way aime at a farre greater power over men, then the Biſhops had of late, whom for that cauſe they counted Popiſh? what did thoſe wordes elſe of one in my hearing diſcover: <hi>We ſhall</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>be as much troubled with the Juſtices of Peace, as we were before with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, if there be not ſome order taken with them:</hi> and that device of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that for the government of the Church <hi>we onely that had beene moleſted by the Biſhops ſhould be imployed in that, and they that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:155912:52"/> beene any way Prelaticall, ſhould have nothing at all to do therein:</hi> Sir, thoſe expreſſions and ſuch like did (I muſt confeſſe) begin to worke the firſt ſuſpicion in me of my Brethren: I (before) did thinke they had all endeavoured as I did, at the reformation of evill, and not at their owne ſupremacy, both over their Brethren, and the Gentry too; therefore for my part I ſhall rather chooſe to walke in the low way alone, then in that High way with them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Doctrine of <hi>Popery</hi> hath alwaies beene a <hi>Doctrine of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> and cruelty, the whole booke of Martyrs doth ſufficiently ſhew it; and may it not be ſaid of them that pretend they are the reformers of <hi>Popery</hi> amongſt us, that <hi>deſtruction and violence are in their waies?</hi> for their cruelty, I thinke that reverend <hi>Brother</hi> of ours, did ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate it by the reſolution he gave to a tender Conſcience deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know whether it were lawfull to lend or give mony to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this warre againſt the King: His Anſwer, as I heard, was Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and his reaſon was taken from the Examples of <hi>Succoth</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuell</hi> who <hi>were rent with briars and thornes</hi> when the Captaine retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe they had not given him their aſſiſtance; and to prevent a like puniſhment he concluded it was lawfull to give; the reſolution was <hi>doughty,</hi> but it inferr'd Cruelty in the exactors: And ſo my ſelfe talke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with another about this buſineſſe of plate and money, his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, we had better give then not, for <hi>if the King prevailed, wee were like to find mercy from him, for he was gratious and pitifull, and would in his Princely compaſſion conſider the inforcement that was uſed upon us, and the danger we were in; but if they prevailed on the other ſide, nothing but cruelty in the exceſſe could be expected from them;</hi> could their any more be ſaid of the Papiſts?</p>
               <p>It is true as the Papiſts cry out of the Cruelty of the Proteſtants, ſo do they, of thoſe of the Kings party, but why do men practice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what they condemne in others?<note place="margin">Author of the Pamphlet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name of God, &amp;c.</hi> Pag 21.</note> How cruelly they of the Kings ſide demeane themſelves I know not; but this I know however that unreverend ſpeaker is pleaſed to call the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> with the King, <hi>clouts,</hi> and <hi>ragges,</hi> and <hi>wiſpes,</hi> appointed of God <hi>to ſcoure ſuch uncleane veſſels as himſelfe is;</hi> yet they are better bred then thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons emploied to plunder and ſpoile us, and a <hi>Noble, Gentile</hi> ſpirit ordinarily ſcornes Cruelty.</p>
               <p>Secondly thoſe Declarations that come from His Majeſtie, if as we
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:155912:53"/> are urged to beleeve, are made by his <hi>Cavaleers,</hi> we may ſay their breath is not ſo nauſeous, to the apprehenſion of a Goſpellike ſpirit as that of others, we do not meet with <hi>Kill, ſlay, and deſtroy</hi> in any of theſe expreſſes, which indeed is the Language of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Apollyon</hi> a deſtroier; where ever I heare <hi>Kill, ſlay and deſtroy:</hi> I conceive it to be the Language of <hi>Abaddon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay in one thing more let me ſhew you the Spirit of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in this new way: As the aime of the wicked Papiſts hath beene cheifely to defile mens Conſciences, and to deſtroy their ſoules, by labouring to perſwade them by promiſes and threats to recant and deny the truth of God which they have profeſſed, as is evident by many examples in the booke of <hi>Martyrs:</hi> and becauſe they would not do that, therefore was that mercy leſſe Cruelty excerciſed upon them: ſo is it the faſhion now, I can ſpeake it by experience: when I had beene a priſoner for preaching the truth of Jeſus the ſpace of ſeventeene dayes, I addreſſed my ſelfe unto that member, who (by ſeduction onely as I hope) was made the firſt inſtrument of my drunken adverſary to bring me into trouble, (for I thought it my duty out of love to his ſoule, to deny my ſelfe and beg a plaiſter from that hand, that moſt unjuſtly had given the wound) and to this end I obteined your moſt friendly and brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly letter unto him: but what did I meet withall, a ſerious perſuaſion to recant, whereto I anſwered that <hi>I durſt not deny the truth of God which I had preached;</hi> He moſt diſcreetly replied, yea <hi>but the truth muſt not be ſpoken at all times: I humbly anſwered, that a divine truth is then in ſpeciall to be ſpoken and mainteined by them that are entruſted with it of God when 'tis in danger to be loſt;</hi> which he alſo denied, (but (as be ſaid) his buſineſſe was ſuch, that he could not ſtand to argue the caſe with me:) by which I gathered, that if I would have defiled my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in diſclaiming that <hi>depoſitum</hi> which God had committed to my charge, I might haply at this preſent have enjoyed my living and the Society of my wife and children: But (Sir) I did ſee the Hand of God bringing me before the Parliament, as well as the hand of that member; and although perhaps he brought me upon the ſtage of trouble, that I might deny the truth of God, yet I am ſure Gods end was that I might confeſſe the ſame to his glory, and truly He muſt pardon me, if I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſatisfy Gods expectation before his: for I am more behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God then I am to him.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:155912:53"/>
               <p>Laſt of all (though I could inſtance in as many more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) the endeavours of the Papiſts have beene chiefly to ſuppreſſe the moſt honeſt men that have beene in judgement differing from themſelves: to defame and abuſe them, that the world might thinke that they did deſervedly ſuffer thoſe further cruelties which they would afterward inflict upon them; And is not this the practice of thoſe that are for this new way of reſiſtance; yourſelfe know's (if you remember) who told mee, that, <hi>becauſe I was an honeſt man, I did more hurt to the cauſe then an hundred knaves, and therefore I was liable to ſuffer accordingly:</hi> and ſo I thinke I have ſince that time, for (after my impriſonment, and five more journeies, upon new calls, and by Purſevants unto <hi>London</hi>) when it was apprehended I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant: My living (I know not wherefore) was ſequeſtred, a ſtranger put into it, my wife and children threatned to have the houſe beaten downe over their head, unleſſe they would reſigne up all to the will my drunken and malicious adverſaries, who have power put into their hands to take mee, and carry mee priſoner to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> or otherwiſe to abuſe mee, as they ſhall pleaſe: and thus the Papiſts did with the Martyrs of Chriſt; nay, thus <hi>Pilate</hi> dealt with Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>tradidit Jeſum volvntati eorum,</hi> (ſaies the ſpirit) he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Jeſus to the will of thoſe that moſt maliciouſly cried out againſt him: and this is my comfort in mine affliction, my conformity to my Maſter.</p>
               <p>And in the point of defamation, theſe <hi>new way</hi> men are fully as dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous as the Papiſts, for on the ſuddaine they can do that againſt a faithfull Miniſter, which the devill in many yeares was not able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>ſcil.</hi> make him a ſcandalous Miniſter, by caſting iniquity upon him, or by ranking him in that number: whereby hee becomes farre more odious in the judgement of the vulgar, then if by his owne ſins, and Satans temptations he had made himſelfe ſuch a one indeed; and hereby is diſcovered the greatneſſe of their power, but indeed Gods omnipotency is diſcovered another way, namely by turning evill into good, and by drawing a beautifull world out of a confuſed Chaos: 'tis true I confeſſe they have a tricke to make evill men good too, upon the ſuddaine, for let thoſe that were ſcandalous before, but ſpeake for this warre, and urge people to lend money, and perſiſt in this way of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, why on the ſuddaine all their former faults appeare to be but
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:155912:54"/> imperfections: or, 'tis concluded for certaine of their converſion, and <hi>you may ſee (will they ſay) how Gods bleſſing goes along with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there was never heard of ſuch admirable Converts, and of ſuch floats of them in the daies of the Prelates;</hi> by which kind of expreſſions I feare Gods name is rather blaſphemed, then truly honored: Sir, I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to evidence unto you, that all theſe and many ſuch waies the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Ieſuites walke in; therefore I ſay whoever promoteth this new way doth thereby introduce Popery, and manifeſtly breakes his Proteſtation, which for my part I dare not do.</p>
               <p>Thus (reverend Sir) you have ſeene diverſe of my reaſons why I cannot go with your ſelfe and my brethren in this your new way: I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it to be againſt God, deſtructive to his Law, inconſiſtent with the Goſpell, contradicting the practice of Chriſtianity, oppoſite to the calling of our miniſtry, contrary to common prudence, to humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to nature, and to reaſon; to our oath of Allegiance, and our late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation: ſo that I hope you will thinke from theſe grounds that my diſſent from you, is not becauſe I am given up to the ſpirit of madnes, as ſome conclude.</p>
               <p>And now (deare friend) do not blame me, if I wiſh your returne unto my ſelfe into that good old way, wherin we formerly walked together, in which onely you did Chriſt good ſervice; for by your ſtepping into this new way, I can aſſure you that both Chriſt and you have loſt, though the cauſe hath gained. Sir let me beg of you againe (as before by my private letters I have done) and even for Chriſt his ſake, that you would deny your ſelfe, and ſpeedily put forth your ſtrength to prevent (what in you lies) the ruine of this <hi>Noble Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that bred and foſterd you: you were wont to be ready to every good worke and motion, and you cannot imagine what good your returne might do, I dare ſay it would recall many of our Brethren: what if the rageing <hi>Genius</hi> of the times ſhould impriſon you, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt you of your outward ſubſiſtence (as it hath done me,) yea what if it ſhould ſhed your bloud for your revolting from it, and rebuking of it, it would be both Chriſts gaine, and your glory: If your <hi>Conſcience</hi> tells you, that you have too highly offended your <hi>King,</hi> know that your <hi>Soveraigne</hi> is the Image of your <hi>Saviour</hi> in meekeneſſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; O helpe to make up that great breach which you have unadviſedly beene a meanes to widen betweene him and his people. your aime at
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:155912:54"/> firſt was (as I hope) Gods glory, and the purging of his Church, your unhappineſſe was to pitch upon the wrong way, wherein you have gone beyond your ſelfe and purpoſe. O confeſſe it, and come out of it, and the good hand of the Lord ſhall againe be with you and upon you.</p>
               <p>And for the Parliament ſake, (whoſe reputation next to Chriſts glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the Kings honour, I am bound to regard) I would begge one thing at your hands, wherein I thinke you may do as much as any one man; and that is, that you would ſolicite the ſame, that your Brethren of the Miniſtry who are in tribulation for preaching the truth of Jeſus, and obedience to their Soveraigne, may not be dealt withall as <hi>John Hus</hi> was at the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> of whom it was ſaid, <hi>Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus eſt, non confutatus Huſſius,</hi> burnt, but not confuted; ſo that we might not be condemned unheard, and unconvinced: that ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Members, (who doubtleſſe (as men) may be ſeduced by ill Counſell) might not be ſuffered in the name of the whole Parliament to turne out of their Livings Gods painfull Miniſters, with their wives and children, upon the malicious information of ſome beaſtly drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. I am credibly informed, that when my Living was ſequeſtred, and a ſtranger put in, and my ſelfe forced to flie for the ſafety of my life, and my houſe threatned to be beat downe upon my wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, unleſſe they with my aged parent would quietly depart they knew not whither, and reſigne it up unto my enemies, even ſome of them my adverſe neighbours had ſome regret of ſpirit at this great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and ſaid, if he (meaning my ſelfe) had offended the Parliament, yet what hath the poore woman and her tender infants done? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it (Sir) this is not for the honour of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>You know how the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were cryed out upon by ſome, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Miniſters out of their freeholds; but they heard them firſt, told them what they would doe before hand, and for what cauſe, and was this their fault? ſhould they have done it on the ſuddaine and ſaid nothing, had it beene lawfull then? well fare <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> yet, and <hi>Edmund Boner,</hi> for they by their Chaplaines would labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and convert men to themſelves, before they would condemne them, and give them up to the ſecular power; nor do I reade they did then put power into the hands of their profeſſed enemies and accuſers, to afflict and hurt them: Worthy Sir, if you ſhall pleaſe to conſider of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:155912:55"/> this, &amp; put to your helping hand, many that are in perſecution for their faithfulneſſe to Chriſt, and their love unto their <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged unto you. I move you not to ſollicite, that we might have leave to lay open the conditions of our adverſaries, when they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, drunken, blaſphemous, and perjured perſons, becauſe I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Chaire-man, that it was not the cuſtome of that Court to permit ſuch a thing, which he called <hi>recrimination,</hi> becauſe it had beene a practice in the High Commiſſion: But (Sir) my deſire one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, that wee might be ſuffered to diſpute the caſe before wee be condemned, that the Court might not be ſo liable to be ill thought of: Never among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> was any man condemned for a point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, till the ſame had firſt beene determined upon, to be erroneous by ſome Aſſembly or Convocation; but when or where in this Church was this point of obedience to the Lords Annointed, (for which we ſuffer) adjudged culpable?</p>
               <p>And (Sir) for my ſelfe, if it were lawfull for a perſecuted Miniſter to ſpeake in his owne defence, againſt a perjured blaſphemous drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, I could evidence, that nothing but my oppugning his ſinnes is the root of my ſufferings: indeed now ſuch perſons have got a tricke whereby they will ſuppreſſe us all, unleſſe Gods mercy doe prevent it; whatever ſinne we preach againſt, if they doe but ſay we preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Parliament,</hi> they boaſt they ſhall be beleeved, for they are for the Affirmative; and the Miniſter with his Negatives is of no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, though he bring his witneſſes: wherefore now they reſolve that ſinne ſhall live without controule, at his perill the Miniſter muſt not meddle with it, for if he doe, they make no more to put him by, from preaching Gods Word, and to caſt him out of his Living, then they do for to be drunken; you may well thinke that my drunken adverſary was confident to prevaile, when he offered to lay wagers before hand that he would effect this againſt me, which he hath done. Sir, when I preached againſt Treaſon, Rebellion, and Diſobedience, then they ſaid (no queſtion but) I meant the Parliament; afterward I preached againſt Lying, Slandering, and Malice, and this they ſaid was againſt the Parliament too, and got me to be ſent for up againe by a Purſevant about the ſame; nay (Sir) when I did but quote thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth unto death, and many goe therein;</hi> this they ſaid was againſt the Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:155912:55"/> the <hi>major</hi> part of people in thoſe parts are for the ſame: and when I quoted that place in the 120 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> where <hi>David</hi> ſayes, that <hi>He was for Peace, but others were for Warre; when he ſpake of that, they made them ready for battaile,</hi> this alſo they ſaid was for the King, and againſt the Parliament. When I preached againſt vaine-glory, upon thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>I ſeeke not the praiſe of men,</hi> they ſaid I preached againſt that Member, unto whom in my behalfe you writ your Letter, when I proteſt I never thought of him all the while I was upon that ſubject, (that I know of) ſave onely when I prayed for my enemies: my cuſtome being to apprehend the wrong that any doth me, as Gods call unto me to pray for that man in particular, and therefore then I uſe to thinke of ſuch in my prayers.</p>
               <p>But (Sir) I pray conſider whether the Parliament be not abuſed by theſe men as well as I, yet I alone from ſome of its Members muſt beare the puniſhment: alas! if God gives up ſome to make lyes, and others to beleeve lyes, how can I helpe it? I confeſſe I doe admire at the humility of thoſe <hi>Members,</hi> who will condeſcend ſo low, as to be inſtruments of ſuch baſe and inferiour perſons malice againſt any of Gods Miniſters whom they know not: But alas, I beleeve indeed the reaſon in part is their ignorance, they doe not know the men; for had they knowne, they would not ſo farre have conſented to them: Now (Sir) it being unlawfull (as it ſeemes) for ſuch a one as I to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the abuſe which ſuch conditioned accuſers doe offer to that high Court, and to the Members thereof: I deſire that you would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to doe the ſame in the behalfe of the reſt of your Brethren of the Miniſtry, who have not yet drunke of that bitter cup which I have taſted, but are haply liable thereunto.</p>
               <p>And now (Sir) I intreat you to pardon me if I have erred in theſe lines, by my length, or any other way; you know my phraſe and ſtile both in writing and ſpeaking, 'tis alwayes plaine: wherefore if expreſſions at the firſt reliſh appeare unpleaſing, let your wonted love interpret well; my zeale (I hope) is right, and my love I am ſure is unfeigned unto you: I would not willingly offend my moſt deadly foe, much leſſe mine indeared friend, by whoſe ſociety I have formerly enjoyed much good: wherefore in confidence of your well acceptance of my ſincere thoughts, I take my leave of you,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:155912:56"/> commending you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to re-call from errours, and to direct in all truth both you and me, who ſhall by the helpe of that Word and Grace ever be</p>
